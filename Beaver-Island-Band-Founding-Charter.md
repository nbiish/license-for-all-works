# Constitution and Corporate Charter of the Beaver Island Band of Indians

## PREAMBLE

We, the Beaver Island Band of Indians, a sovereign Indigenous nation whose rights and existence predate the United States of America and the State of Michigan, establish this Constitution and Corporate Charter. Our lineage is rooted in the sacred Midewiwin Society, guided by the Seven Fires Prophecy, and proven by ancestral honors and treaty leadership. This document is an instrument of the Tribe, affirming our inherent sovereignty and right to self-government.

We form this government to secure state and federal recognition, restore our land base, preserve our culture, and provide for the health, education, and welfare of our members for the next seven generations and beyond. We seek to reunite our people, whose families were scattered across continents by the historical persecution of our ceremonies, by creating a governing structure that transcends physical borders. We are committed to a path of vigilant discernment, ensuring our sovereignty remains uncompromised by any internal or external actors. We blend traditional wisdom with modern expertise to build a strong and prosperous future.
