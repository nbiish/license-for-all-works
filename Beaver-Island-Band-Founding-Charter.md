# Interim Charter of the Beaver Island Band of Indians

## PREAMBLE

This Charter establishes the Beaver Island Band of Indians, Inc. (hereafter "the Organization"), a non-profit entity incorporated under the laws of the State of Michigan, for the sole and exclusive purpose of acting as the administrative and governmental arm of the Beaver Island Band of Indians (hereafter "the Tribe"). The Tribe is a distinct and sovereign Indigenous nation whose existence and rights predate the United States and the State of Michigan, as recognized in treaties and historical records.

This Organization is formed as a practical necessity to navigate the legal and financial systems of the United States and the State of Michigan. Its existence as a state-chartered entity shall not be construed in any way as a diminishment, waiver, or relinquishment of the inherent sovereignty of the Tribe. It is an instrument of the Tribe, not a subordinate of the state. The ultimate purpose of this Organization is to secure full state and federal recognition for the Tribe, to restore its land base, to protect its culture and heritage, and to provide for the health, education, and welfare of its members from this generation unto the seventh generation.

## ARTICLE I: PURPOSE AND SOVEREIGN POWERS

1.  **Primary Purpose:** To formalize the existence of the historic Beaver Island Band of Indians and to secure its official status as a federally recognized Indian Tribe.
2.  **Sovereign Assertion:** The Organization shall assert and defend the inherent sovereign rights of the Tribe, including but not limited to rights of self-government, sovereign immunity, and the right to define its own membership, laws, and traditions.
3.  **Grant Administration:** To solicit, receive, and administer grants, donations, and any other funds from public and private sources to be used exclusively for the advancement of the Tribe and its members.
4.  **Cultural Preservation:** To acquire, hold, and protect cultural items, ancestral remains, traditional knowledge, and intellectual property of the Tribe.
5.  **Member Services:** To establish and operate programs that provide for the social, educational, economic, and cultural needs of the Tribe's members.

## ARTICLE II: GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP

1.  **Founder and Interim Hereditary Chief:** ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, is hereby recognized as the founder of this Organization and shall hold the title of Interim Hereditary Chief for the duration of his natural life.
2.  **Plenary Authority of the Founder:** In recognition of the fractured state of the community and the singular dedication required to re-establish the Tribe, the Founder shall possess full and final authority (plenary authority) over all decisions, actions, and affairs of the Organization. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   The appointment and removal of all officers and council members.
    *   The approval of all budgets and expenditures.
    *   The direction of all legal and political strategies.
    *   The final interpretation of this Charter.
3.  **Transitional Council:** The Founder shall appoint an initial advisory council of no fewer than three (3) and no more than seven (7) members from the Tribe's membership roll. This council shall serve at the pleasure of the Founder to provide advice and assist in the administration of the Organization.
4.  **Succession:** The Founder is tasked with establishing, before his passing, a formal constitution and a process for transitioning from his singular leadership to a fully elected Tribal Council, ensuring the continuity of the Tribe's government. This future constitution shall supersede this Interim Charter upon its formal ratification by the membership.

## ARTICLE III: MEMBERSHIP

1.  **Base Roll:** The initial membership of the Tribe shall consist of individuals who can provide documented proof of lineal descent from members of the historic Beaver Island Band of Indians, as validated and certified by the Founder.
2.  **Future Enrollment:** The Founder shall establish an enrollment committee and a formal ordinance to govern the process for all future applications for membership.

## ARTICLE IV: JURISDICTION AND LEGAL STANDING

1.  **Assertion of Inherent Jurisdiction:** The Tribe, acting through this Organization, asserts inherent civil and regulatory jurisdiction over its members and its lands (as they are acquired).
2.  **No Waiver of Sovereign Immunity:** The act of incorporating under state law is not a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Tribe or this Organization from suit in any court—tribal, state, or federal—except where explicitly waived by a formal resolution for a specific, limited purpose.
3.  **Controlling Law:** This Charter, and all subsequent laws and ordinances passed by the Tribe, shall be the controlling law for the Organization and its members. State and federal law shall be considered applicable only where Tribal law is silent and where such external law does not infringe upon the Tribe's inherent sovereignty or this Charter.
