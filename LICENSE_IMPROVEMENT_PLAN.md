# Plan: Improve Comprehensive Restricted Use License

This document outlines the plan to refine the "COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS".

**Objective:** Enhance the license's comprehensiveness and legal robustness, ensure consistent use of all recognized names, and add clarifying definitions.

**Phase 1: Analysis & Information Gathering (Complete)**

1.  **Extract Names:** Identified the full set of names and identifiers from `Tribal-Consulting-Agreement.md`:
    *   Traditional Name: ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi)
    *   Legal Name: JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE
    *   Professional Documentation Name: Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise
    *   Anishinaabek Dodem (Clan): Animikii (Thunder)
    *   Affiliation: Enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI)
2.  **Analyze Existing License:** Reviewed the provided license text.

**Phase 2: Planned Improvements (Approved)**

1.  **Add "Definitions" Section:** Introduce a dedicated section at the beginning to formally define key terms like "Commercial Use," "AI Training," "Derivative Work," "Traditional Knowledge (TK)," "Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs)," and "Indigenous Data Sovereignty" as used within this license.
2.  **Add "Declaration of Name Usage" Section:** Introduce a dedicated section explicitly listing all names/identifiers and their significance.
3.  **Placeholder Clarification:** Add a note explaining that placeholders (`<|repo_title|>`, `<|current_year|>`) need replacement upon use.
4.  **Consistency Check:** Perform a final review to ensure the full name set is used consistently everywhere the rights holder is mentioned.
5.  **Review Section 7.7 (Continuity of Compensation):** Ensure alignment with the consulting agreement's Section 18, refining wording for clarity.
