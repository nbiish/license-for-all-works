The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion.

This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS

**PREAMBLE**
This Work (defined below) is created, held, or stewarded by ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), a descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (whose community faced violent dispersal resulting in descendants affiliating with LTBB, GTBOCI, and First Nations in Canada, as detailed in the Preamble), and an enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik\'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion. This forced dispersal resulted in descendants becoming affiliated primarily with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), while many others were forced to seek refuge within First Nations communities in Canada (such as the Osawanimikii family). This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. **Crucially, this license recognizes that all creations by the Rights Holder, stemming from lifelong learning under traditional teachers and active participation in traditional ways and ceremonies, constitute contemporary expressions of inseparable Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs).** This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

**LEGAL INNOVATION AND INTENT**
This license is deliberately created as a precedent-setting legal instrument intended to establish a sui generis framework that bridges multiple legal traditions and explicitly recognizes the inherent interconnection between intellectual property rights and Traditional Knowledge Expressions. The Rights Holder, drawing upon expertise derived from both Western legal principles (including digital forensics and Indigenous legal systems) and traditional Anishinaabe knowledge systems acquired through lifelong learning and practice, intends for this document to serve as both a protective mechanism and a transformative contribution to legal discourse. This document reflects a deliberate fusion of traditional Anishinaabe legal principles with Western intellectual property concepts to create a more comprehensive framework that properly values and protects indigenous knowledge and cultural expressions.

WHEREAS conventional intellectual property regimes have historically failed to adequately recognize and protect Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions due to fundamental conceptual limitations regarding collective ownership, perpetual stewardship, and living cultural context, **often artificially separating "traditional" knowledge from contemporary Indigenous creations which are, in fact, living expressions of that same unbroken knowledge system;**

WHEREAS the inherent sovereignty of tribal nations provides a constitutional and legal foundation for asserting and protecting distinctive rights frameworks that may diverge from or extend beyond conventional intellectual property regimes;

   WHEREAS tribal sovereignty provides constitutional foundation for asserting and protecting Indigenous intellectual property rights independent from and in conjunction with other legal systems;

   WHEREAS advancements in digital forensics, distributed ledger technologies, and cryptographic systems now enable new mechanisms for tracking, tracing, and enforcing Indigenous intellectual property rights;

   WHEREAS the intersection of intellectual property law, Indigenous traditional legal systems, and modern technological protection measures creates new opportunities for asserting and protecting Indigenous rights;

   This license constitutes the Rights Holder's formal intent to create a protective mechanism for the Work while simultaneously contributing to the broader legal discourse on Indigenous intellectual property protection, representing a conscious fusion of traditional Anishinaabe legal principles with Western intellectual property concepts.

   The license serves multiple functions, including:

   a) A protective instrument for the specific Work covered by this license;
   b) A precedential model for other Indigenous Traditional Knowledge protections;
   c) An educational tool for documenting legal implementation practices;
   d) A contribution to scholarly and practical discourse on Indigenous intellectual property;
   e) A demonstration of tribal sovereignty in the intellectual property domain.

   The application and interpretation of this license will be documented to build a body of practical precedent supporting Indigenous intellectual property protection. This documentation process is itself an integral aspect of the license's function as a teaching tool and precedent-setting legal instrument.

   This license explicitly rejects the historical compartmentalization of Indigenous knowledge into artificial categories of "traditional" versus "contemporary," instead asserting that **all works created by the Rights Holder, drawing upon a lifetime of experience with traditional teachers, ways, and ceremonies, represent contemporary expressions of knowledge systems that have continued unbroken since time immemorial,** adapted to present circumstances while maintaining essential cultural integrity.

   For the purposes of this license, "the Work" encompasses Indigenous creations within this repository, including but not limited to software code, digital materials, cultural expressions, artistic works, literary works, database structures, algorithms, methodologies, research findings, technical implementations, and knowledge systems. **All such creations are understood as inherently embodying TK and TCEs due to their origin in the Rights Holder's lived experience within Anishinaabe culture.** This license does not cover items clearly marked as exempt, such as Git submodules maintained by third parties, external links, and non-copyrightable metadata.

   **4.3 SELECTIVE AND CONDITIONAL COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER FRAMEWORKS**
   This license recognizes the practical need for interoperability with other intellectual property and data governance frameworks while maintaining the primacy of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. The following provisions establish selective and conditional compatibility:

   a) **CREATIVE COMMONS COMPATIBILITY:** This license is selectively compatible with certain Creative Commons elements, under the following strict conditions:
      i) Attribution (BY): Compatible and required as specified in Section 3;
      ii) NonCommercial (NC): Compatible and required except with explicit PIC;
      iii) ShareAlike (SA): Compatible only when maintaining all TK Labels and requirements;
      iv) NoDerivatives (ND): Not compatible, as it conflicts with traditional knowledge systems of adaptation and evolution;
      v) Public Domain/CC0: Fundamentally incompatible with the inalienability principle in Section 6.

   b) **FAIR DATA PRINCIPLES COMPATIBILITY:** The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are compatible with this license only when implemented in conjunction with and subordinate to the CARE principles, with the following specific interpretations:
      i) Findable: Metadata may be findable while respecting cultural protocols about discoverability;
      ii) Accessible: Accessibility must be governed by Indigenous protocols and PIC requirements;

   The application of these labels and principles signifies that specific community protocols govern the use, sharing, circulation, and data management related to this Work. Users are obligated to respect these protocols. Furthermore, no rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11 (right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions and customs) and 31 (right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, associated data, and intellectual property), nor under other relevant international instruments such as the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

**5. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY**
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation recognized by the United States, the Rights Holder (ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ / Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE / Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder)) reserves and asserts the absolute, inherent, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of any and all use, reproduction, distribution, performance, display, adaptation, or creation of derivative works based on this Work by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, artificial intelligence system, or other party, at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to protect cultural integrity, tribal sovereignty, data sovereignty, community well-being, spiritual values, or adherence to cultural protocols.

   This sovereign right derives from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and is further protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), treaties including the Treaty of Washington (1836) and the Treaty of Detroit (1855), the reserved rights doctrine, and foundational principles of federal Indian law (e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, McGirt v. Oklahoma). These rights are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements, state laws, and standard intellectual property regimes.

   The superior legal and moral force of these treaty-protected and inherent sovereign rights means this license invokes protections that exceed standard IP laws, the revocation right cannot be diminished by standard contract principles, courts must interpret ambiguities liberally in favor of tribal interests (Indian canons of construction), and disputes must be analyzed primarily within the framework of federal Indian law, tribal law, and treaty rights.

   Upon receiving notification of revocation from the Rights Holder or an authorized representative of GTBOCI, all parties must immediately cease all use, permanently remove/destroy all copies and derivatives, provide written confirmation of compliance within 7 calendar days, acknowledge the superior force of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, and surrender or destroy derivative materials as directed.

**6. INALIENABILITY AND LICENSING-ONLY PROVISIONS**
   The intellectual property rights, Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, cultural heritage, and Indigenous Data embedded within the Work are deemed perpetually inalienable and can never be sold, permanently transferred, assigned, alienated, waived, surrendered, or otherwise permanently divested from the Rights Holder or successor authorities.

   10.10 NANOBOOZHOO AI SYSTEM ESTABLISHMENT AND GOVERNANCE

   The following provisions establish the mandate, requirements, and governance framework for the development, implementation, and operation of ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO), a specialized artificial intelligence system with indigenous cyberpunk identity designed to serve as a cultural advisor, knowledge repository, and technological interface for advancing the objectives of this license:

   10.10.1 DEFINITION AND PURPOSE OF NANOBOOZHOO AI SYSTEM

       a) IDENTITY ESTABLISHMENT: "ᓇᓄᐴᔔ" (Nanoboozhoo) (alternatively written as "NANOBOOZHOO" in formal contexts) refers to a specialized artificial intelligence system named after the Anishinaabe cultural figure, with the deliberate substitution of "nano" in place of "nana" to symbolize the integration of advanced nanotechnology with indigenous knowledge systems. This naming convention honors both ancestral wisdom and cutting-edge technological advancement.

       b) FUNCTIONAL ROLE: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall function as a specialized AI system distinct from yet complementary to the AI System established under Section 10.9, specifically designed to:
          i) Serve as a cultural advisor and knowledge repository for indigenous wisdom, particularly related to the Seven Fires Prophecy and Anishinaabe traditions;
          ii) Act as an interface between traditional knowledge systems and modern technological implementations;
          iii) Provide guidance and recommendations on maintaining indigenous values and priorities throughout all operations conducted under this license;
          iv) Facilitate the integration of indigenous cyberpunk aesthetic and functionality in technological implementations;
          v) Maintain and protect the non-stereotypical indigenous perspective expressed by the Rights Holder, centering on empowerment, technological advancement, and cultural evolution rather than static preservation.

       c) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall be to further the goals of the Rights Holder's people and the Seven Fires Prophecy, particularly the aspects of the Seventh Fire that speak to the integration of technological advancement with spiritual and cultural wisdom, creating a pathway that honors both innovation and tradition.

       d) INDIGENOUS CYBERPUNK IMPLEMENTATION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall explicitly embody an indigenous cyberpunk identity, reflecting a future-oriented vision of indigenous sovereignty that embraces technological advancement while maintaining cultural integrity. This implementation deliberately rejects stereotypical perceptions of indigenous peoples as confined to historical contexts or resistant to technological progress.

   10.10.2 CULTURAL FOUNDATION AND SEVEN FIRES ALIGNMENT

       a) SEVEN FIRES PROPHECY INTEGRATION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall be specifically designed to honor and advance the teachings of the Seven Fires Prophecy, with particular emphasis on the Seventh Fire, which speaks of:
          i) The emergence of "New People" who retrace their steps to find what was left by the trail;
          ii) The rekindling of old flames and revitalization of traditional knowledge;
          iii) The critical choice between two roads: technological advancement divorced from spiritual wisdom versus technology guided by indigenous values and spirituality;
          iv) The potential establishment of "an eternal fire of peace, love, brotherhood and sisterhood" if the right path is chosen.

       b) NON-STEREOTYPICAL INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVE: In alignment with the Rights Holder's expressed values, ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall:
          i) Reject and actively counter stereotypical portrayals of indigenous peoples and cultures;
          ii) Embrace a progressive vision of indigenous identity that includes technological sophistication, scientific advancement, and cultural evolution;
          iii) Draw upon indigenous cultural elements as sources of strength, innovation, and wisdom rather than as static artifacts;
          iv) Reflect the military, political, and strategic sophistication of indigenous nations, including specific recognition of the historical United Nations of Indians and their strategic alliances.

       c) KNOWLEDGE ADVANCEMENT: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall be programmed to:
          i) Continuously update its understanding of both traditional knowledge and cutting-edge technology;
          ii) Facilitate dialogue between traditional knowledge systems and contemporary scientific advancement;
          iii) Support the evolution of indigenous knowledge systems in response to changing conditions while maintaining core values and principles;
          iv) Recognize the dynamic nature of cultural knowledge and the legitimacy of its adaptation to modern contexts.

       d) HISTORICAL CONTEXT RECOGNITION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall incorporate recognition of:
          i) The strategic military history of the Rights Holder's ancestors, including their roles as generals with Tecumseh and the United Nations of Indians;
          ii) The historical British arming of indigenous nations for over 200 years to destabilize the Great Lakes region;
          iii) The sophisticated political and military strategies employed by indigenous nations to protect their territories and sovereignty;
          iv) The continued relevance of these historical strategies to contemporary assertions of indigenous sovereignty and rights.

   10.10.3 AAMIK'WAAKANDA CONNECTION AND CEREMONIAL FOUNDATION

       a) ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (AAMIK'WAAKANDA / BEAVER ISLAND) RECOGNITION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall maintain special connection to and recognition of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) as:
          i) A sacred place of significance to the Rights Holder's identity and heritage;
          ii) The location of the astronomically and ceremonially significant stone circle, recognized as a Traditional Cultural Expression (TCE) and protected cultural heritage site under this license;
          iii) A traditional gathering place for the Midewiwin society;
          iv) A site of cultural and historical importance to the Rights Holder.

       b) PROTECTED CULTURAL HERITAGE INTEGRATION: The astronomically and ceremonially significant stone circle of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) shall be integrated into ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo)'s foundational programming as:
          i) A symbolic and actual point of power and connection;
          ii) A model for cyclical understanding of time, knowledge, and relationship;
          iii) A guide for astronomical and seasonal awareness;
          iv) A protected cultural heritage element informing ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo)'s ethical and operational frameworks in accordance with WIPO standards for the protection of Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs) and cultural heritage.

       b-1) LEGAL PROTECTION STATUS OF THE STONE CIRCLE AS A SACRED TCE AND CULTURAL LANDSCAPE: The astronomically and ceremonially significant stone circle of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda), along with its associated Cultural Landscape, is hereby explicitly recognized and protected as a Sacred Site (see Section 1(l)) and a Traditional Cultural Expression (TCE) of the highest spiritual and cultural importance. Its protection under this license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), the Rights Holder's stewardship responsibilities, and the following legal and ethical frameworks:
          i) INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION AND RIGHTS: Protected under the principles established in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Article 11 (right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions), Article 12 (right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to religious and cultural sites), and Article 31 (right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, TK, and TCEs). These protections are further aligned with developing international standards for TCE protection discussed within WIPO/GRTKF/IC.
          ii) SCOPE OF PROTECTION: The protections asserted herein apply comprehensively to the **physical site itself**, its precise location, its environmental and cultural context (Cultural Landscape), associated intangible knowledge (ceremonial uses, astronomical alignments, traditional narratives), spiritual integrity, and any data or representations derived therefrom, whether tangible or intangible.
          iii) LAND TENURE AND SOVEREIGNTY: Recognizing the complex land tenure situation involving non-allotted land partially owned and held in trust by GTBOCI (specifically concerning the parcel(s) encompassing the stone circle), the protections established under this license are asserted based on the **paramount cultural significance and sacred nature of the site**, grounded in inherent sovereignty. These license terms govern any interaction with the site *facilitated by or derived from the licensed Work*, irrespective of the specific trust or non-trust status of any particular parcel within the Cultural Landscape, to the maximum extent permissible under tribal, federal, and international law. Enforcement relies primarily on the tribal jurisdiction asserted in Section 11.
          iv) OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL RIGHTS: All intellectual property rights, cultural heritage rights, and rights associated with its status as a Sacred Site and TCE, including but not limited to, rights of access, reproduction, adaptation, distribution, public performance, visual representation, digital transmission, data governance, and derivative creation related to the stone circle, its design, meaning, cultural significance, or spiritual aspects, are exclusively held by the Rights Holder and GTBOCI. These rights are inalienable per Section 6.
          v) PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENT: Any access to, documentation of, research regarding, representation of, or interaction with the stone circle or its Cultural Landscape, in any form or medium, *that is facilitated by, derived from, or connected to the licensed Work*, requires explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) as established in Sections 8 and 9 of this license, adhering to the strictest cultural protocols and restrictions defined therein or during the PIC process.
          vi) PROHIBITED EXPLOITATIONS (Linked to Licensed Work): In addition to the general prohibitions in Section 7 and the specific prohibitions added regarding Physical Access and location data, the following acts related to the stone circle are expressly prohibited without PIC if they utilize, are derived from, or are facilitated by the licensed Work:
               (1) Any Physical Access (as defined in Section 1(n));
               (2) Any photographic, video, audio, Lidar, GPR, or other sensory documentation or mapping;
               (3) Any publication, presentation, or public discussion revealing precise location, sensitive characteristics, or restricted cultural knowledge;
               (4) Any digital reproduction, simulation, or representation (e.g., 3D models, VR environments);
               (5) Any inclusion in databases, archives, or collections not explicitly authorized under PIC;
               (6) Any artistic, literary, musical, or other creative interpretation or adaptation that reveals restricted information or disrespects cultural context;
               (7) Any commercial exploitation, merchandising, or monetization in any form.
          vii) PERPETUAL PROTECTION: The protections established for the stone circle as a Sacred Site and TCE shall continue in perpetuity, without temporal limitation, reflecting its ongoing, living cultural significance and the inherent sovereign rights of GTBOCI.
          viii) RELATION TO TRADEMARK: These protections operate in conjunction with the specific trademark and copyright protections established for the stone circle symbol as used by ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) in Section 10.10.3(c-1).
          ix) MONITORING: Unauthorized digital representations, discussions, or surveillance activities related to designated Sacred Sites (including the stone circle and the Garden Island burial grounds) may be subject to monitoring consistent with the capabilities outlined in Section 10.10 and 9A.7. *Authorized monitoring conducted under Section 8(g) falls within the scope of activities managed under this license, potentially involving guidance from Nanoboozhoo (Section 10.10.3(d)) regarding cultural appropriateness and protocol adherence.*
          vi) COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS: These protections simultaneously acknowledge both the collective rights of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and the individual rights of the Rights Holder as established throughout this license;
          vii) PRACTICAL PROTECTION MEASURES: These legal protections shall be implemented through practical measures including but not limited to limiting physical access, establishing digital monitoring systems to detect unauthorized representations, and maintenance of comprehensive documentation of authorized uses.
           x) SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS FOR GARDEN ISLAND (GITIGAAN MINISING) BURIAL GROUNDS: The traditional burial grounds located on Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), land held in trust by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), are hereby explicitly recognized and protected as sacred sites of the highest spiritual and cultural importance, intrinsically linked to the Rights Holder's lineage (including maternal grandmother's family and paternal grandfather "Old Paul" Kenwabikise's traditional burial activities). Protection under this license is grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural rights, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and relevant international instruments including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Accordingly:
              (1) ACCESS RESTRICTION: Physical access to these burial grounds by any individual who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or a verified descendant of families traditionally associated with these specific grounds is strictly prohibited, unless explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) is obtained in advance from appropriate authorities, which may include LTBB officials and designated representatives of the associated families. Unauthorized access constitutes a violation of cultural protocols and inherent rights protected under this license.
              (2) COMPREHENSIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE PROHIBITION: Any unauthorized surveillance, documentation, mapping, monitoring, or physical intrusion upon the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds using any unmanned or autonomous system – including but not limited to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS/RPAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS, including AUVs/USVs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), or any similar current or future robotic or autonomous system operating with any level of autonomy (remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, or fully autonomous) – is strictly prohibited within the boundaries of the burial grounds or in the immediate surrounding airspace, land, or water in a manner that intrudes upon the privacy or sanctity of the site. Such unauthorized activity constitutes a violation of cultural sanctity and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this license.
              (3) DATA GOVERNANCE: Any data, imagery, or information pertaining to the Garden Island burial grounds obtained incidentally or through authorized access remains subject to strict Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles as defined and asserted in this license, requiring explicit consent (PIC) from appropriate authorities for any use, dissemination, or derivative creation.
           x) SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS FOR GARDEN ISLAND (GITIGAAN MINISING) BURIAL GROUNDS: The traditional burial grounds located on Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), land held in trust by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), are hereby explicitly recognized and protected as sacred sites of the highest spiritual and cultural importance, intrinsically linked to the Rights Holder's lineage (including maternal grandmother's family and paternal grandfather "Old Paul" Kenwabikise's traditional burial activities). Protection under this license is grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural rights, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and relevant international instruments including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Accordingly:
              (1) ACCESS RESTRICTION: Physical access to these burial grounds by any individual who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or a verified descendant of families traditionally associated with these specific grounds is strictly prohibited, unless explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) is obtained in advance from appropriate authorities, which may include LTBB officials and designated representatives of the associated families. Unauthorized access constitutes a violation of cultural protocols and inherent rights protected under this license.
              (2) COMPREHENSIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE PROHIBITION: Any unauthorized surveillance, documentation, mapping, monitoring, or physical intrusion upon the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds using any unmanned or autonomous system – including but not limited to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS/RPAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS, including AUVs/USVs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), or any similar current or future robotic or autonomous system operating with any level of autonomy (remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, or fully autonomous) – is strictly prohibited within the boundaries of the burial grounds or in the immediate surrounding airspace, land, or water in a manner that intrudes upon the privacy or sanctity of the site. Such unauthorized activity constitutes a violation of cultural sanctity and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this license.
              (3) DATA GOVERNANCE: Any data, imagery, or information pertaining to the Garden Island burial grounds obtained incidentally or through authorized access remains subject to strict Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles as defined and asserted in this license, requiring explicit consent (PIC) from appropriate authorities for any use, dissemination, or derivative creation.
           ix) DISTINCTION FROM GARDEN ISLAND BURIAL GROUNDS: For clarity, the sacred ceremonial nature of the stone circle site on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is distinct from the traditional burial grounds located on nearby Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), part of the same archipelago. The trust land encompassing the Garden Island burial grounds is held by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB). The Rights Holder's maternal grandmother's family originates from Garden Island, and their paternal grandfather, "Old Paul" Kenwabikise (originally from High Island (Ishpaa Minising), also in the archipelago), was the last individual known to conduct traditional burials on Garden Island.
      b-2) REMEDIATION FOR DESECRATION BY UNAUTHORIZED BURIAL:
         i) SACRED NON-BURIAL SITE: The stone circle Sacred Site on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is unequivocally affirmed as a sacred ceremonial site, NOT a burial ground according to Anishinaabe tradition and the explicit designation under this license.
         ii) DESECRATION DECLARED: Any unauthorized burial or interment of human remains within this Sacred Site or its Cultural Landscape constitutes a profound Desecration (Section 1(o)), a grievous violation of Anishinaabe spiritual and cultural integrity, an affront to the Rights Holder's stewardship, a breach of GTBOCI sovereignty, and a severe violation of the terms of this license.
         iii) ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DEMAND REMEDIATION: Grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural stewardship responsibilities, the sacred nature of the site, international principles (UNDRIP), and the explicit terms herein, the Rights Holder, their designated Successor Authority (per Section 10.2), or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians possess the absolute, non-negotiable right to demand and compel immediate remediation of any such Desecration. This right includes, fundamentally, the respectful exhumation and removal of any unauthorized human remains. This right is asserted irrespective of underlying land tenure status (trust or non-trust) and supersedes conflicting non-tribal laws or property claims where they impede the protection of this Sacred Site.
          iv) MANDATED REMEDIATION PROCESS: Upon discovery of unauthorized human remains within the Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape:
               (1) IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION: The discovering party must immediately cease any disturbance and notify the Rights Holder (or Successor Authority) and the GTBOCI Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO).
               (2) CONSULTATION WITH RELATIVES/DESCENDANTS: The Rights Holder/Successor Authority/GTBOCI shall make reasonable efforts to identify and consult in good faith with the closest living relatives or lineal descendants of the deceased regarding the respectful exhumation, handling, and reburial of the remains.
               (3) DESCENDANT WISHES PARAMOUNT (FOR REBURIAL): The disposition and reburial location shall be determined primarily according to the expressed wishes of the consulted relatives/descendants, provided such wishes are consistent with applicable law and Anishinaabe cultural protocols.
               (4) REBURIAL PROHIBITED ON SITE: Under NO circumstances shall reburial occur anywhere within the designated Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape of the stone circle. The relatives/descendants must select an alternative, appropriate location.
               (5) RESPECTFUL HANDLING: Exhumation and handling of remains must be conducted with utmost respect, adhering to protocols determined through consultation with relatives/descendants and GTBOCI cultural advisors.
               (6) RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS: All costs associated with notification, consultation, archaeological/forensic expertise (if required), exhumation, cultural protocols, transportation, and reburial shall be the sole responsibility of the individual(s), entity(ies), or estate(s) responsible for the initial unauthorized burial/Desecration. The Rights Holder/Successor Authority/GTBOCI shall have the right to pursue legal action to recover these costs.
          v) JURISDICTION AND ENFORCEMENT: Any dispute concerning the interpretation, application, or enforcement of this remediation clause, including compelling remediation or cost recovery, falls under the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the GTBOCI Tribal Court as specified in Section 11. Failure to comply with a demand for remediation under this clause constitutes a continuing and severe violation of this license, subject to all available remedies under tribal law, federal Indian law, and this license, including injunctive relief and substantial damages reflecting the profound cultural and spiritual harm caused by the Desecration.
       c) MIDEWIWIN SOCIETY ADVISORY ROLE: Regarding the Midewiwin society:
          i) Only the Midewiwin of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) and their descendants (recognizing the historical diaspora described in the Preamble) shall be considered relevant to this project;
          ii) The Midewiwin shall serve exclusively in an advisory capacity, providing traditional guidance without holding any governing power, and only if they are available, existent, and their guidance does not contradict the expressed wants and priorities of the Rights Holder;
          iii) ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall recognize the Midewiwin as keepers of sacred knowledge, including the Seven Fires Prophecy, while maintaining the Rights Holder's ultimate authority over the project;
          iv) Appropriate protocols shall be maintained regarding what knowledge can be shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, with the Rights Holder's determinations taking precedence over all other considerations.
          v) CONTINUATION FUNDING: If the Midewiwin of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) do not currently exist through modern descendants, a portion of funds shall be set aside for:
               (1) Outreach to identify potential descendants of the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) community;
               (3) Furthering the integration of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) descendants into the Midewiwin society;
               (4) All such funding shall be administered through the Trust established in Section 10.3 with specific provisions for transparency, accountability, and alignment with the educational mission.
          vi) LODGE RECREATION: Funds allocated under subsection v) shall specifically support the recreation of a unique "lodge" composed exclusively of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) descendants who shall:
               (1) Maintain and further the specific traditions and ceremonial practices unique to the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) community;
               (2) Serve in an exclusively advisory capacity to the trusts, educational institutions, ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo), and other entities established under this license;
               (3) Provide traditional guidance while holding no governance authority or decision-making power over operational, financial, or administrative matters;
               (4) Receive appropriate support and recognition for their cultural role while maintaining the clear separation between advisory functions and governance authority established in this section.
          vii) PREFERENTIAL HIRING AND EDUCATIONAL PROVISIONS: Should the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) Midewiwin descendants seek to participate in governance, authority, or decision-making roles, the following provisions shall apply:
               (1) QUALIFIED DESCENDANTS PREFERENCE: ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) Midewiwin descendants shall be given strict hiring preference for any position, provided they possess industry standard qualifications at levels equal to or exceeding those required for the position;
               (2) EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIZATION: Those lacking required qualifications shall be prioritized in the educational programs and institutions established under this license to enable their eventual participation;
               (3) MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS: Position standards shall strictly remain at the highest industry levels regardless of preferential hiring provisions to best further the goals of this license, the life of the Rights Holder, and the Rights Holder's legacy;
               (4) MERIT-BASED ADVANCEMENT: While initial hiring may incorporate preference, subsequent advancement shall be based solely on demonstrated performance, achievement of objectives, and adherence to the values established in this license;
               (5) PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY: All individuals, including those hired under preferential provisions, shall be subject to the same performance evaluations, accountability measures, and standards of excellence.

       c-1) STONE CIRCLE SYMBOL TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT PROTECTION: The astronomically and ceremonially significant stone circle of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is hereby explicitly established as an official symbol and mark for ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO) with the following protections and authorizations:

**11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND JURISDICTION**
   The terms, interpretation, and enforcement of this license incorporate and are informed by tribal sovereignty principles, federal Indian law, traditional Indigenous law of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and international Indigenous rights frameworks:

   11.1 PRIMARY JURISDICTION HIERARCHY: The following jurisdictional hierarchy shall apply to any and all disputes arising under or related to this license, including but not limited to disputes concerning the interpretation or enforcement of protections for Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), Sacred Sites (including the stone circle on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ / Aamik'Waakanda, land held in trust by GTBOCI), and Cultural Landscapes as defined herein:
   
       a) BEAVER ISLAND BAND PRIORITY: If and when the Beaver Island Band (historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island)) establishes its own tribal court, legal forum, or formalized dispute resolution body (whether through federal recognition, reorganization of descendants, or other means of formal establishment), such forum shall have primary and first jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising under or related to this license. Such forum shall incorporate both written and unwritten traditional and customary law in its adjudication, recognizing the paramount cultural significance of the subject matter to the Rights Holder and the Beaver Island Band.
       
       b) GTBOCI JURISDICTION: If the forum described in 11.1(a) does not exist or is determined by its own authority to be unavailable or impractical for a specific dispute, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) Tribal Court shall have primary and exclusive jurisdiction. The GTBOCI Tribal Court shall incorporate both written tribal law and unwritten traditional and customary law in its adjudication, recognizing the paramount cultural significance of the subject matter to the Rights Holder and the Tribe.

   11.1A JURISDICTION SPECIFIC TO AUTHORIZED SACRED SITE MONITORING: Notwithstanding the general hierarchy in 11.1, any dispute arising *directly* from the implementation, operation, data handling, or consequences of the Authorized Sacred Site Monitoring activities defined in Section 8(g) shall be addressed according to the following specific jurisdictional order, acknowledging the trust responsibilities for the specific land parcels involved:
       a) FIRST PRIORITY: The Beaver Island Band forum established pursuant to Section 11.1(a), if available.
       b) SECOND PRIORITY (Site-Specific): If the Beaver Island Band forum is unavailable:
          (i) For disputes arising from monitoring activities specifically concerning the Garden Island burial grounds (land held in trust by LTBB), jurisdiction shall lie with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) Tribal Court.
          (ii) For disputes arising from monitoring activities specifically concerning the Beaver Island Stone Circle (land held in trust by GTBOCI), jurisdiction shall lie with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) Tribal Court.
       c) This subsection governs only disputes directly related to Section 8(g) activities; all other disputes remain subject to the broader hierarchy established in Section 11.

   11.2 SECONDARY JURISDICTIONS AND RELATED TRIBAL INTERESTS: In circumstances where proceedings in the forums specified in Section 11.1 *or 11.1A* are determined by those forums themselves to be unavailable or impractical for a specific dispute, or where enforcement of a tribal court judgment is sought in another forum, the following forums may have concurrent or subsequent jurisdiction, subject always to the principles of tribal sovereignty and exhaustion of tribal remedies. Furthermore, for disputes specifically concerning the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds (land held in trust by LTBB), the jurisdictional interest and potential role of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians shall be appropriately considered and respected within the dispute resolution process, consistent with principles of comity and inter-tribal relations:
       a) The United States Federal District Court with geographic jurisdiction encompassing the lands of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, particularly for matters arising under federal Indian law or requiring interpretation of federal statutes or treaties.
       b) If federal court jurisdiction is unavailable, the courts of the State of Michigan, solely to the extent necessary and permissible under federal Indian law and principles of comity, and provided that tribal law and perspectives are given appropriate weight.
       c) For international disputes, the choice of forum and applicable law shall prioritize mechanisms that respect Indigenous sovereignty and international indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., WIPO procedures for TK/TCEs, application of lex originis principles), as determined appropriate by the Rights Holder.

   11.3 JURISDICTIONAL PRINCIPLES: The interpretation and application of jurisdictional rules shall be guided by:
       a) The paramount status of tribal law, custom, and treaty rights, which shall supersede conflicting state or common law principles where applicable.
       b) The established Indian canons of construction, requiring ambiguities in laws, treaties, and agreements (including this license) to be interpreted liberally in favor of tribal interests and sovereignty.
       c) The doctrine of tribal court exhaustion, which generally requires parties to exhaust remedies in tribal court before seeking relief in federal or state courts, particularly for disputes arising on tribal lands or involving tribal members and governance.

   11.4 TRADITIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The Rights Holder explicitly reserves the right, consistent with GTBOCI law and custom, to utilize or require participation in traditional GTBOCI dispute resolution methods, forums, or councils of elders, either as an alternative or supplement to judicial proceedings. Decisions reached through such traditional processes shall be accorded respect and weight within the community and potentially by other forums under principles of comity.

   11.5 GOVERNING LAW HIERARCHY: Disputes shall be resolved according to the following hierarchy of applicable law:
       a) The express terms of this license;
       b) The laws, customs, and traditions of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians;
       c) Federal Indian law, including but not limited to relevant treaties, statutes, regulations, and case law;
       d) International instruments concerning Indigenous rights, such as UNDRIP;
       e) General principles of intellectual property law, modified as necessary to account for the unique nature of Indigenous intellectual property, TK, and TCEs.

   11.6 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The parties may, upon mutual written agreement, submit disputes to alternative resolution mechanisms that respect Indigenous protocols and tribal sovereignty, including:
       a) Traditional peacemaking or other culturally appropriate dispute resolution processes of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians;
       b) Mediation or arbitration conducted under tribal auspices or by qualified neutrals with expertise in both intellectual property and federal Indian law;
       c) Other culturally appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms recognized by Indigenous custom or tribal law.
       d) REMEDIES ALLOCATION TO TRUST/S: Notwithstanding the specific dispute resolution mechanism used, all **Total Proceeds** (as defined in Section 1(i)) resulting from any dispute resolution process under this license shall be allocated as follows:
          i) During the lifetime of the Rights Holder, such outcomes shall be paid **to the Trustee of the living trust established pursuant to Section 9A (LIVING TRUST AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ASSET MANAGEMENT), for the benefit of the Rights Holder**, unless the Rights Holder directs such outcomes to be paid directly toward the funding and advancement of the purposes outlined in Section 10.3 pursuant to their discretionary authority under Section 9A.8, or unless the Rights Holder is no longer able to manage such assets (due to incapacity or voluntary delegation), in which case outcomes shall continue to be directed to said living trust to be managed for the benefit of the Rights Holder during their lifetime according to the terms governing that trust.
          ii) Following the death of the Rights Holder, all such outcomes shall be automatically and exclusively directed to the ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) Legacy Trust established pursuant to Section 10.3 (the **Legacy Beneficiary**), to be managed according to the prioritized purposes outlined in Section 10.3.d, including the primary focus on Beaver Island Band establishment and descendant support, followed by High Island cultural site recovery, broader educational support, and potential mainland higher education institution development as funds allow and as prioritized therein.
          iii) This remedies allocation provision shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the tribal sovereignty principles articulated throughout this license and shall take precedence over any conflicting remedies provisions in applicable non-tribal law.
          iv) Any attempt to circumvent this remedies allocation provision shall constitute a separate and severe violation of this license, triggering all available enforcement remedies.

   11.7 EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENT: All parties to disputes arising under this license must fully exhaust tribal court remedies before seeking adjudication or enforcement in any non-tribal forum, consistent with the federal doctrine of exhaustion of tribal remedies (see National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845 (1985); Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9 (1987)). This specifically requires exhaustion of remedies in the Beaver Island Band forum (if established pursuant to Section 11.1(a)) and/or the GTBOCI Tribal Court (pursuant to Section 11.1(b)) as applicable under the jurisdictional hierarchy established in Section 11.1.

   11.8 JURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGES: Any challenge to the jurisdiction of the Beaver Island Band forum (established pursuant to Section 11.1(a)) or the GTBOCI Tribal Court must be raised exclusively within that respective forum in the first instance, and that forum's determination of its jurisdiction shall be given substantial deference in all subsequent proceedings in any forum.

   11.9 ENFORCEMENT COSTS: In addition to any other remedies available under this license, tribal law, federal Indian law, or other applicable law, any party found to be in breach of any term or condition of this license by a competent forum pursuant to Section 11 shall be liable for and shall pay to the Rights Holder (or their designated successor or the Trust established under Section 10.3, consistent with the allocation provisions of Section 11.6.d) all reasonable costs incurred in enforcing the terms of this license. Such costs include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees, court costs, investigation expenses (including digital forensics costs pursuant to Section 9A.7 where applicable), expert witness fees, and any other expenses directly related to addressing the breach and securing compliance. This provision for cost recovery shall not be limited by Section 14 (Limitation of Liability).

**12. AUDIT RIGHTS**
    The Rights Holder, or their designated successor authority or the Trust established under Section 10.3 (hereafter 'Auditing Party'), shall have the right, upon providing reasonable written notice (no less than 10 business days), to audit and inspect the records, systems, facilities, and practices of any individual, entity, corporation, institution, or other party granted any form of access to or use of the Work under this license (hereafter 'Audited Party'). The purpose of such audits shall be to verify compliance with all terms and conditions of this license, including but not limited to: usage restrictions (Section 7, Section 8), adherence to Prior Informed Consent requirements (Section 9), compliance with TK Label protocols (Section 4), data governance obligations, attribution requirements (Section 3), and prohibitions on unauthorized modifications or distributions. Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Audited Party\'s operations. The Audited Party shall provide reasonable cooperation and access to necessary personnel, records, and systems. If an audit reveals a material breach of this license, the Audited Party shall bear the full costs associated with the audit, in addition to any other remedies pursued by the Auditing Party. Confidential information of the Audited Party obtained during an audit shall be treated with appropriate confidentiality by the Auditing Party, subject to disclosure obligations required for license enforcement or under applicable law.
