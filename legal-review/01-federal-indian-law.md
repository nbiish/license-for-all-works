# Federal Indian Law Analysis & Amendments

**Document:** 01-federal-indian-law.md  
**Priority Level:** CRITICAL  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## I. Current License Provisions - Federal Indian Law Framework

### A. Constitutional Supremacy (Lines 5-7)

**Current Language:**
> "This license operates under the constitutional supremacy framework established by Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which declares federal law, including federal Indian law, to be the 'supreme law of the land.'"

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Correctly invokes Supremacy Clause
- ✓ Identifies federal Indian law as supreme law
- ⚠ Lacks specific enumeration of which federal Indian laws apply
- ⚠ Missing connection to Commerce Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 3) - the constitutional source of Congress's Indian affairs power

### B. Treaty Rights Integration (Line 7)

**Current Language:**
> "Federal Indian law, including the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.), Worcester v. Georgia (31 U.S. 515 (1831))..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Cites Worcester v. Georgia (foundational sovereignty case)
- ✓ References Indian Arts and Crafts Act
- ✗ Does NOT specifically cite GTBOCI's actual treaties (1836 Treaty of Washington, 1855 Treaty of Detroit)
- ✗ Missing citation to specific treaty language preserving rights
- ✗ No reference to "reserved rights doctrine"

### C. Sovereign Immunity (Section 12.1, Lines 89-92)

**Current Language:**
> "Nothing in this license shall be construed as a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians or any other tribal nation. Consistent with Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751 (1998), tribal sovereign immunity is explicitly preserved and protected under this license."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Explicitly invokes Kiowa Tribe precedent
- ✓ Preserves GTBOCI sovereign immunity
- ⚠ Potential conflict with Section 11.6 (enforcement costs) which could be construed as money judgment consent
- ⚠ Missing analysis of commercial activity exception
- ⚠ No discussion of individual capacity suits against tribal officials

### D. Tribal Court Jurisdiction (Section 11.1, Lines 1376-1378)

**Current Language:**
> "All parties must first exhaust available tribal court remedies before seeking relief in any other forum. This exhaustion requirement is a mandatory prerequisite to any action in another court and is based on the well-established principles of comity..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Correctly invokes National Farmers Union exhaustion doctrine
- ✓ Makes exhaustion mandatory
- ⚠ Does NOT cite Montana v. United States test for tribal jurisdiction over non-members
- ⚠ Missing specific jurisdictional basis (consensual relationships, conduct threatening tribe)
- ⚠ No discussion of Public Law 280 states

---

## II. Critical Federal Indian Law Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability 1: Insufficient Treaty Rights Grounding

**Issue:** The license references Worcester v. Georgia but fails to cite the actual treaties between the United States and the Ottawa and Chippewa peoples, specifically:

1. **Treaty of Washington (1836)** - 7 Stat. 491
2. **Treaty of Detroit (1855)** - 11 Stat. 621

**Why This Matters:**
- Treaty rights are **constitutionally protected** under Art. VI and cannot be abrogated except by clear Congressional intent (Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U.S. 404 (1968))
- Treaties contain **reserved rights** - anything not explicitly ceded remains with the tribe (Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564 (1908))
- Intellectual property and cultural resources are **implicitly reserved** even if not mentioned in treaties (fishing/hunting rights analogy)

**Current Risk:**
Without explicit treaty grounding, courts may view this purely as a contract or copyright license subject to standard preemption analysis, rather than an exercise of treaty-protected sovereign rights.

**Legal Precedent:**
- *Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass'n*, 443 U.S. 658 (1979) - treaties reserve rights not explicitly ceded
- *Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians*, 526 U.S. 172 (1999) - treaty rights survive statehood
- *Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community*, 572 U.S. 782 (2014) - tribal sovereign immunity applies to off-reservation commercial activity

---

### Vulnerability 2: Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta Inadequately Addressed

**Issue:** The license mentions Castro-Huerta (Line 7) but does not adequately explain how it preserves exclusive federal/tribal jurisdiction despite the 2022 Supreme Court decision allowing concurrent state criminal jurisdiction.

**Castro-Huerta Holding (597 U.S. ___ (2022)):**
- States have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians for crimes against Indians in Indian country
- **BUT**: This applies only to criminal jurisdiction, not civil matters
- **AND**: Federal preemption can still exclude state jurisdiction where Congress/tribes have occupied the field

**Why This Matters:**
Civil intellectual property disputes are NOT subject to Castro-Huerta's criminal jurisdiction holding, but hostile courts might try to extend the reasoning. The license must explicitly distinguish civil IP jurisdiction.

**Current Risk:**
A sophisticated defendant might argue Castro-Huerta reflects broader Supreme Court skepticism of exclusive tribal jurisdiction, seeking to apply it by analogy to civil disputes.

**Protective Strategy Needed:**
- Emphasize civil vs. criminal distinction
- Invoke comprehensive federal regulatory scheme for Indian arts/crafts
- Assert complete tribal governance over intellectual property as "internal tribal affairs"

---

### Vulnerability 3: Montana Test Not Addressed for Non-Member Defendants

**Issue:** The license does not address *Montana v. United States*, 450 U.S. 544 (1981), which limits tribal jurisdiction over non-members.

**Montana Rule:**
Tribes lack civil jurisdiction over non-members **UNLESS**:
1. Non-member enters **consensual relationships** with tribe/members through commercial dealing, contracts, etc., OR
2. Non-member conduct **threatens or has direct effect on tribal political integrity, economic security, health, or welfare**

**Why This Matters:**
Most license violators will be non-tribal members. Courts will apply Montana to test tribal court jurisdiction.

**Current License Strengths (Implicit Montana Compliance):**
- ✓ License creates **consensual relationship** - using the Work = agreeing to terms
- ✓ Misappropriation of TK/TCE **directly threatens** tribal cultural integrity (Montana exception 2)
- ✓ Economic harm from IP theft threatens tribal economic security

**Current Risk:**
License does not **explicitly** invoke Montana framework, leaving courts to infer compliance. Sophisticated defendants will challenge jurisdiction without seeing Montana analysis.

---

### Vulnerability 4: Federal Preemption Not Distinguished from State Preemption

**Issue:** License conflates federal Indian law preemption (which **protects** tribal authority) with Copyright Act preemption (which could **undermine** tribal authority).

**Two Types of Preemption:**

1. **Federal Indian Law Preempts State Law** (GOOD for tribe)
   - *White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker*, 448 U.S. 136 (1980)
   - Federal/tribal law occupies field → state law excluded
   - Protects tribal sovereignty

2. **Copyright Act Preempts State/Tribal Law** (BAD for tribe)
   - 17 U.S.C. § 301
   - Federal copyright law preempts state laws granting equivalent rights
   - Could preempt tribal intellectual property laws

**Current Risk:**
License does not clearly establish which type of preemption applies when. A court could find the TK/TCE protections preempted by § 301, reducing the license to standard copyright.

---

### Vulnerability 5: Indian Arts and Crafts Act Underutilized

**Issue:** License mentions IACA (25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.) but does not integrate its criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms.

**IACA Protections:**
- **Criminal penalties**: Up to 15 years imprisonment for falsely suggesting Indian origin (§ 305e(b))
- **Civil remedies**: Treble damages or $1,000 per day (whichever is greater) (§ 305e(d))
- **Standing**: Tribe, Indian arts organization, or individual Indian can sue
- **Strict liability**: No intent requirement

**Why This Matters:**
IACA provides **federal statutory basis** for protecting Indigenous cultural expressions that is **NOT subject to Copyright Act preemption** because it's a separate federal statute protecting a different interest (preventing fraud and cultural misappropriation).

**Current Risk:**
By not fully integrating IACA, the license misses an independent legal basis that could survive a preemption challenge to the copyright-based provisions.

**Example Integration:**
> "Any use of the Work that misrepresents its origin, authorship, or tribal affiliation violates not only this license but also the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, 25 U.S.C. § 305e, subjecting the violator to federal criminal prosecution and civil liability for treble damages."

---

## III. Federal Indian Law Case Precedent Analysis

### A. Foundational Sovereignty Cases

#### 1. Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. 515 (1832)

**Holding:** Indian nations are "distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive."

**Application to License:**
- Tribal authority over intellectual property created by tribal members is "internal tribal affair"
- State law cannot interfere with tribal governance of cultural resources
- Federal treaties protect tribal sovereignty

**Language to Add:**
> "Consistent with Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. 515 (1832), the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians retains exclusive authority over intellectual property, Traditional Knowledge, and Traditional Cultural Expressions created by its members as a matter of inherent sovereignty and internal tribal governance, which states and non-federal actors may not abridge."

---

#### 2. Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959)

**Holding:** State courts lack jurisdiction over civil disputes between non-Indians and Indians arising on reservation where exercise would undermine tribal self-government.

**Application to License:**
- Disputes over IP created by tribal member involve tribal governance
- State courts cannot hear cases that would undermine tribal cultural protection
- Even off-reservation IP has tribal nexus

**Language to Add:**
> "Under the Williams v. Lee infringement test, state court jurisdiction over disputes arising from this license would impermissibly infringe on the Grand Traverse Band's right of self-government over intellectual property and cultural resources, necessitating exclusive tribal court jurisdiction as the primary forum."

---

#### 3. Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981)

**Holding:** Tribes lack general civil jurisdiction over non-members, EXCEPT for consensual relationships and conduct threatening the tribe.

**Application to License:**
- License acceptance creates **consensual relationship**
- IP misappropriation **threatens tribal cultural integrity**
- Both Montana exceptions satisfied

**Language to Add:**
> "Tribal court jurisdiction over users of this Work is established under both exceptions to Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981): (1) by using the Work, users enter into a consensual relationship with the Rights Holder and the Grand Traverse Band through commercial dealing and contractual agreement; and (2) unauthorized use, misappropriation, or violation of this license constitutes conduct that directly threatens the tribal political integrity, economic security, and cultural welfare of the Grand Traverse Band, its members, and the broader Anishinaabe cultural heritage."

---

#### 4. National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe of Indians, 471 U.S. 845 (1985)

**Holding:** Tribal court exhaustion required before federal court can review tribal jurisdiction.

**Current License:** ✓ Correctly invokes this (Lines 1376-1378)

**Strengthening Language:**
> "Pursuant to National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845 (1985), and Iowa Mutual Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9 (1991), any party challenging tribal court jurisdiction must first exhaust all available tribal court remedies, including appellate review, before seeking federal court review. This exhaustion requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional, not merely prudential."

---

#### 5. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782 (2014)

**Holding:** Tribal sovereign immunity applies to off-reservation commercial activity; Congress has not abrogated immunity for commercial torts.

**Application to License:**
- Even off-reservation IP licensing protected by sovereign immunity
- State cannot sue tribe for breach of off-reservation IP agreement
- Individual tribal members acting as "Rights Holder" may have different status

**Critical Distinction:**
The Rights Holder (individual tribal member) is NOT the same as the tribe itself. Sovereign immunity protects **the tribe** but does not necessarily protect **individual tribal members** acting in personal capacity.

**Language to Clarify:**
> "While this license explicitly preserves the sovereign immunity of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and other tribal nations (per Kiowa Tribe and Bay Mills), the Rights Holder ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) acts in both individual capacity and as a representative of tribal interests, with sovereign immunity protections applying to tribal governmental functions while enforcement actions may be pursued in individual capacity as appropriate."

---

### B. Federal Preemption Protecting Tribal Authority

#### 6. White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136 (1980)

**Holding:** Federal/tribal regulation of on-reservation activity preempts state taxation where comprehensive federal scheme exists.

**Application to License:**
- Comprehensive federal scheme for Indian arts/crafts, cultural resources
- Federal Indian law + tribal law = complete regulatory framework
- State IP law preempted where it conflicts

**Balancing Test:**
1. Federal/tribal interest in regulation
2. State interest in regulation  
3. Degree of federal/tribal regulation

**Language to Add:**
> "Under the Bracker preemption analysis, state law is preempted where federal and tribal interests in intellectual property protection, combined with the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme for Indian arts and crafts (25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.), Indian Child Welfare Act (recognizing tribal cultural protection interests), and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (protecting cultural items), demonstrate such extensive federal/tribal governance that state law must yield to avoid undermining tribal self-determination and federal policy promoting tribal sovereignty."

---

#### 7. New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324 (1983)

**Holding:** Comprehensive tribal hunting/fishing regulation preempts conflicting state law even where state has general regulatory authority.

**Application to License:**
- If tribe comprehensively regulates IP, state cannot interfere
- Licensing framework = comprehensive tribal regulation
- Analogy to natural resources regulation

**Language to Add:**
> "As in Mescalero Apache Tribe, where comprehensive tribal regulation of natural resources preempted state wildlife laws, the Grand Traverse Band's comprehensive regulation of intellectual property, Traditional Knowledge, and Traditional Cultural Expressions through this license and tribal law preempts conflicting state intellectual property, contract, or cultural property laws that would undermine the tribal regulatory scheme."

---

### C. Recent Sovereignty Cases (Post-2010)

#### 8. McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020)

**Holding:** Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation boundaries remain intact; Oklahoma lacks criminal jurisdiction over crimes by/against Indians in Indian Country.

**Application to License:**
- Strong reaffirmation of treaty rights and Indian Country status
- "Disestablishment" requires clear Congressional intent
- Protects tribal territorial sovereignty

**Strategic Value:**
McGirt signals Court's return to treaty textualism and reluctance to find implicit abrogation.

**Language to Add:**
> "Consistent with the principles of treaty interpretation reaffirmed in McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), the Treaties of 1836 and 1855 between the United States and the Ottawa and Chippewa peoples contain no clear evidence of Congressional intent to abrogate tribal sovereignty over intellectual property, cultural resources, or Traditional Knowledge, and the reserved rights doctrine therefore protects such inherent sovereign authority."

---

#### 9. Dollar General Corp. v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, 579 U.S. 545 (2016)

**Holding:** (4-4 affirming lower court) Tribe may exercise jurisdiction over non-member corporation for tort claims arising on reservation.

**Application to License:**
- Supports tribal jurisdiction over non-members via Montana exceptions
- Corporate defendants subject to tribal jurisdiction
- Consensual relationship (employment) established jurisdiction

**Language to Add:**
> "Following Dollar General Corp. v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, 579 U.S. 545 (2016), corporate users of this license are subject to tribal court jurisdiction under Montana's consensual relationship exception, as accessing and using the Work constitutes a voluntary commercial relationship with the Rights Holder and the Grand Traverse Band, creating a sufficient nexus for tribal adjudicatory authority."

---

## IV. Recommended Federal Indian Law Amendments

### Amendment 1: Treaty Rights Foundation (CRITICAL)

**Insert After Current Line 7, Before Line 8:**

```markdown
**TREATY RIGHTS FOUNDATION**

The protections established in this license are grounded in and exercise the inherent sovereignty and treaty-reserved rights of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) under:

a) **Treaty of Washington (March 28, 1836)** - 7 Stat. 491, between the United States and the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations, which reserved to the signatory tribes all rights not explicitly ceded, including cultural, intellectual, and spiritual rights over traditional territories and resources;

b) **Treaty of Detroit (July 31, 1855)** - 11 Stat. 621, affirming the continuing government-to-government relationship and reserved rights of the Ottawa and Chippewa peoples;

c) **Reserved Rights Doctrine** - Under *Winters v. United States*, 207 U.S. 564 (1908), and *Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass'n*, 443 U.S. 658 (1979), the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations reserved all rights not explicitly ceded in their treaties with the United States, including the inherent right to protect, control, and govern intellectual property, Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), cultural resources, and associated data created by their citizens and arising from their territories and cultural heritage.

These treaty rights are:
- **Constitutionally protected** under Article VI, Clause 2 (Supremacy Clause)
- **Not subject to state interference** under *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515 (1832)
- **Construed liberally in favor of the tribe** under the Indian canons of construction
- **Capable of evolution and adaptation** to modern circumstances including digital intellectual property (*Menominee Tribe v. United States*, 391 U.S. 404 (1968))

This license constitutes an exercise of these treaty-protected rights and federal trust relationship, placing it beyond the reach of state law and requiring interpretation consistent with federal Indian law's special protections for tribal sovereignty and self-determination.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Establishes constitutional/treaty foundation immune from state law preemption
- Invokes reserved rights doctrine to cover IP even if not mentioned in 1830s treaties
- Cites specific GTBOCI treaties, not generic Indian treaties
- Creates framework for arguing federal preemption protects tribal authority

---

### Amendment 2: Montana Jurisdiction Analysis (CRITICAL)

**Insert in Section 11 (Dispute Resolution), After Line 1217 (jurisdictional principles):**

```markdown
**11.1A MONTANA V. UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONAL FOUNDATION**

Tribal court jurisdiction over users of this license, including non-members of any federally recognized tribe, is established under both recognized exceptions to *Montana v. United States*, 450 U.S. 544 (1981):

a) **CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP EXCEPTION (Montana Exception 1):**
   i) By accessing, downloading, viewing, using, copying, modifying, distributing, or creating derivative works from the Work, users voluntarily enter into a consensual commercial relationship and contractual agreement with the Rights Holder and, through the Rights Holder's tribal membership and the cultural nature of the Work, with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians;
   
   ii) This consensual relationship is established through multiple independent bases:
       (1) **Express Contract Formation**: Acceptance of license terms constitutes offer and acceptance creating bilateral contract;
       (2) **Commercial Dealing**: Use of the Work constitutes commercial dealing in tribal intellectual property;
       (3) **Continuing Relationship**: Ongoing use creates continuing course of dealing subject to tribal governance;
       (4) **Purposeful Availment**: Users purposefully avail themselves of tribal resources, analogous to *Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz*, 471 U.S. 462 (1985);
   
   iii) This exception applies regardless of whether use occurs on or off Indian lands, as the Work itself constitutes tribal cultural property over which the tribe retains governance authority;

b) **CONDUCT THREATENING TRIBAL INTERESTS EXCEPTION (Montana Exception 2):**
   i) Unauthorized use, misappropriation, misrepresentation, commercial exploitation, or other violation of this license constitutes conduct that directly threatens:
       (1) **Tribal Political Integrity**: Undermines tribal authority to govern cultural resources and member activities;
       (2) **Tribal Economic Security**: Deprives tribe of economic benefit-sharing from intellectual property;
       (3) **Tribal Health and Welfare**: Damages cultural integrity, spiritual practices, and community cohesion;
       (4) **Cultural Survival**: Threatens transmission of Traditional Knowledge and cultural continuity;
   
   ii) Protection of intellectual property, Traditional Knowledge, and Traditional Cultural Expressions is a **core governmental function** essential to tribal self-determination and cultural survival, placing jurisdictional authority squarely within *Montana*'s second exception;
   
   iii) The harm from IP misappropriation is not diminished by occurring off-reservation, as cultural harm, economic harm, and sovereignty harm affect the tribe regardless of geographic locus;

c) **ADDITIONAL JURISDICTIONAL BASES:**
   i) **Indian Country Status** (*18 U.S.C. § 1151*): To the extent the Rights Holder resides or creates the Work within Indian Country (including GTBOCI trust lands), tribal jurisdiction is presumptive;
   
   ii) **Williams v. Lee Infringement Test**: State court jurisdiction would impermissibly infringe on tribal self-government over intellectual property and cultural resources created by tribal members, necessitating tribal court as proper forum (*Williams v. Lee*, 358 U.S. 217 (1959));
   
   iii) **Subject Matter Jurisdiction**: Intellectual property disputes involving tribal member creators and tribal cultural content are matters of core tribal concern over which tribes have inherent sovereign authority.

d) **BURDEN OF PROOF:**
   Any party challenging tribal court jurisdiction bears the burden of proving inapplicability of both *Montana* exceptions by clear and convincing evidence, and must first exhaust tribal court remedies including appellate review before seeking federal court intervention (*National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe*, 471 U.S. 845 (1985)).
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Explicitly addresses Montana framework courts will apply
- Provides detailed factual basis for both exceptions
- Anticipates and rebuts jurisdictional challenges
- Cites supporting case law for each proposition
- Shifts burden to defendant to disprove jurisdiction

---

### Amendment 3: Federal Preemption Protecting Tribal Authority (CRITICAL)

**Insert After Section 5 (Line 527), New Section 5A:**

```markdown
**5A. FEDERAL INDIAN LAW PREEMPTION OF CONFLICTING STATE LAW**

To the extent any state law, state court decision, or state regulatory scheme conflicts with or undermines the provisions of this license, such state law is preempted by federal Indian law and tribal sovereignty under the following independent grounds:

a) **SUPREMACY CLAUSE PREEMPTION (U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2):**
   Federal Indian law, including treaties between the United States and the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations, federal statutes governing Indian affairs, and the federal common law of Indian sovereignty, constitutes "supreme law of the land" that preempts conflicting state law. State courts and legislatures lack authority to diminish federal trust responsibility or tribal sovereignty through state IP, contract, or property laws.

b) **BRACKER FIELD PREEMPTION:**
   Under *White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker*, 448 U.S. 136 (1980), state law is preempted where a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme, combined with tribal interests in self-governance, demonstrates federal/tribal occupation of the regulatory field. The following comprehensive federal/tribal framework preempts state interference:
   
   i) Indian Arts and Crafts Act, 25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq. (protecting authenticity and tribal origin of Indian arts);
   ii) Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq. (protecting cultural items);
   iii) Archaeological Resources Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. § 470aa et seq. (protecting archaeological resources);
   iv) National Historic Preservation Act, 54 U.S.C. § 300101 et seq. (protecting historic properties including TCPs);
   v) Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. § 1901 et seq. (recognizing tribal cultural integrity interests);
   vi) Federal trust responsibility to protect tribal cultural resources;
   vii) GTBOCI tribal laws governing intellectual property, cultural resources, and Traditional Knowledge;

c) **CONFLICT PREEMPTION:**
   State law conflicts with federal law where it "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress" (*Hines v. Davidowitz*, 312 U.S. 52 (1941)). Application of state copyright, contract, property, or cultural resource laws would frustrate Congressional objectives to:
   
   i) Promote tribal self-determination and self-governance;
   ii) Protect tribal cultural resources and intellectual property;
   iii) Prevent fraud and misrepresentation in Indian arts and crafts;
   iv) Preserve tribal economic opportunity and wealth reclamation;
   v) Honor treaty commitments and federal trust responsibility;

d) **MESCALERO APACHE PREEMPTION:**
   Following *New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe*, 462 U.S. 324 (1983), comprehensive tribal regulation of intellectual property through this license and tribal law preempts conflicting state regulation. The tribe's substantial governmental interest in protecting its intellectual and cultural resources, combined with the pervasive federal regulatory presence, leaves no room for state interference.

e) **CONGRESSIONAL INTENT:**
   Congress has demonstrated clear intent to promote tribal economic development, cultural preservation, and intellectual property protection through multiple statutory schemes. Allowing state law to override tribal/federal frameworks for TK/TCE protection would directly contravene this Congressional intent.

f) **PRACTICAL APPLICATION:**
   State courts adjudicating disputes under this license must:
   i) Apply federal Indian law as the primary governing law;
   ii) Defer to tribal court interpretations of tribal law and cultural matters;
   iii) Recognize tribal court judgments under principles of comity;
   iv) Abstain in favor of tribal court jurisdiction where appropriate;
   v) Construe ambiguities in favor of tribal sovereignty (Indian canons of construction);

Nothing in this section waives tribal sovereign immunity or consents to state court jurisdiction. This section operates defensively to preclude state law interference with federal/tribal governance of intellectual property and cultural resources.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Distinguishes federal Indian law preemption (protecting tribal authority) from Copyright Act preemption (threatening tribal authority)
- Cites comprehensive federal regulatory framework
- Provides multiple independent preemption theories
- Guides state courts on how to handle disputes if they obtain jurisdiction

---

### Amendment 4: Indian Arts and Crafts Act Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Insert After Section 11 (Anti-Appropriation), New Subsection 11.3A:**

```markdown
**11.3A INDIAN ARTS AND CRAFTS ACT PROTECTIONS**

In addition to the protections afforded by this license, the Work and all Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs) contained herein are protected by the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, as amended, 25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq. ("IACA"), which provides independent federal statutory protection not subject to Copyright Act preemption.

a) **STATUTORY VIOLATIONS:**
   It is a violation of federal law to:
   i) Offer or display for sale any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization (25 U.S.C. § 305e(a));
   
   ii) Misrepresent the Work, any derivative work, or any product incorporating Traditional Knowledge or Traditional Cultural Expressions protected by this license as:
       (1) Having tribal origin, endorsement, or approval when such authorization has not been granted;
       (2) Being created by an Indian individual or tribal member when not factually accurate;
       (3) Being approved or certified by the Rights Holder when such approval has not been obtained;

b) **CRIMINAL PENALTIES:**
   IACA violations are subject to criminal prosecution with penalties of:
   i) First offense: Fine up to $250,000, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both (25 U.S.C. § 305e(b)(1)(A));
   ii) Subsequent offense: Fine up to $1,000,000, imprisonment up to 15 years, or both (25 U.S.C. § 305e(b)(1)(B));
   iii) These criminal penalties apply **in addition to** any civil remedies under this license;

c) **CIVIL REMEDIES:**
   Under 25 U.S.C. § 305e(d), the Rights Holder, the Grand Traverse Band, or any Indian arts and crafts organization may bring civil actions for IACA violations seeking:
   i) Injunctive or other equitable relief;
   ii) Treble damages; OR
   iii) For each day the violation continues: $1,000 per day in the case of an individual violation, $5,000 per day for a first-time violation by a person, $10,000 per day for subsequent violations by the same person;
   iv) The greater of treble damages or per-day damages;
   v) Punitive damages;
   vi) Costs of suit and reasonable attorney fees;

d) **STANDARDS AND BURDEN:**
   i) IACA establishes **strict liability** - no proof of intent to deceive is required;
   ii) The Rights Holder need only prove false suggestion of Indian origin or tribal connection;
   iii) IACA claims may be brought **in addition to and simultaneously with** contract claims under this license;
   iv) IACA provides **federal question jurisdiction** under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, creating alternative pathway to federal court if tribal court jurisdiction is challenged;

e) **TRADEMARK INTEGRATION:**
   The Indian Arts and Crafts Board (25 U.S.C. § 305a) can register official marks for tribes, and misuse of such marks violates both IACA and the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125). The Rights Holder and GTBOCI may pursue both IACA and trademark claims for misappropriation.

f) **REPORTING VIOLATIONS:**
   IACA violations should be reported to:
   - Indian Arts and Crafts Board, U.S. Department of the Interior
   - Federal Bureau of Investigation
   - U.S. Attorney's Office for the relevant district
   The Rights Holder reserves the right to pursue both civil remedies and request criminal prosecution for willful violations.

g) **RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROVISIONS:**
   IACA protections are **cumulative and non-exclusive**. Violators may face:
   - IACA criminal prosecution
   - IACA civil liability (treble damages)
   - License breach remedies (Section 13)
   - Common law fraud/misrepresentation claims
   - Lanham Act false advertising claims (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a))
   - State consumer protection claims (where not preempted)

This federal statutory framework provides robust protection for Indigenous cultural expressions independent of copyright law, and cannot be waived, diminished, or contracted away by this or any other agreement.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Provides independent federal statutory basis surviving Copyright Act preemption
- Creates clear federal question jurisdiction pathway
- Substantial damages deter violations
- Criminal penalties add enforcement teeth

### Amendment 5: Castro-Huerta Distinction (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Insert After Constitutional Supremacy Section (After Line 7):**

```markdown
**CIVIL JURISDICTION PRESERVATION DESPITE CASTRO-HUERTA**

The Supreme Court's decision in *Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta*, 597 U.S. ___ (2022), recognized concurrent state criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians committing crimes against Indians in Indian Country. However, *Castro-Huerta* does **NOT** affect the exclusive federal and tribal civil jurisdiction applicable to this license for the following reasons:

a) **CRIMINAL VS. CIVIL DISTINCTION:**
   *Castro-Huerta* addressed only **criminal jurisdiction** under the Major Crimes Act and General Crimes Act. The Court explicitly limited its holding to criminal prosecutions and did not address civil jurisdiction, which remains governed by *Montana v. United States*, *Williams v. Lee*, and related civil jurisdiction precedents.

b) **CIVIL REGULATORY JURISDICTION RETAINED:**
   Tribal and federal authority over civil matters involving intellectual property, contract disputes, and commercial relationships remains undisturbed by *Castro-Huerta*. Civil adjudicatory jurisdiction follows different constitutional and statutory frameworks than criminal jurisdiction.

c) **DISTINGUISHING FEATURES:**
   i) **Subject Matter**: This license governs civil intellectual property rights, not criminal conduct;
   ii) **Federal Scheme**: Comprehensive federal regulation of Indian arts, crafts, and cultural resources creates exclusive federal/tribal jurisdiction under *Bracker* preemption;
   iii) **Consensual Jurisdiction**: Users consensually submit to tribal jurisdiction by accessing the Work, distinguishing from criminal jurisdiction over non-consensual conduct;
   iv) **Internal Tribal Affairs**: IP created by tribal members is internal tribal governance (*Worcester*), not subject to state interference;

d) **CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE:**
   Congress has the authority to clarify exclusive federal/tribal jurisdiction over civil matters through legislation, and has done so through comprehensive Indian affairs statutes creating pervasive federal regulatory schemes that preclude state involvement.

e) **TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY PRESERVATION:**
   The federal policy promoting tribal sovereignty, self-determination, and economic development (reaffirmed in *Michigan v. Bay Mills*, 572 U.S. 782 (2014)) requires exclusive tribal governance over intellectual property and cultural resources free from state interference, regardless of *Castro-Huerta*'s criminal jurisdiction holding.

f) **ONGOING LITIGATION:**
   As of July 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed multiple suits against Oklahoma district attorneys for sovereignty violations post-*Castro-Huerta* (referenced in license at Line 7), demonstrating continuing federal protection of exclusive federal/tribal jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances. This license aligns with federal policy opposing state encroachment on tribal authority.

**PRACTICAL EFFECT:** State courts have no jurisdiction over disputes arising from this license. Any state court proceedings would violate federal law and tribal sovereignty, subjecting the filing party to immediate jurisdictional challenges, removal to federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, and liquidated damages under Section 11.8 for improper forum selection.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Clearly distinguishes criminal from civil jurisdiction
- Prevents hostile courts from extending Castro-Huerta by analogy
- Cites ongoing federal litigation protecting tribal sovereignty
- Creates record for federal court if removal becomes necessary

### Amendment 6: Individual vs. Tribal Capacity Clarification (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Insert in Section 2 (Declaration of Name Usage), Add New Subsection:**

```markdown
**2.1 CAPACITY AND SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY**

a) **DUAL CAPACITY:**
   The Rights Holder, ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE / Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, acts in multiple capacities under this license:
   
   i) **Individual Capacity**: As the individual creator and rights holder of the Work, capable of entering contracts, pursuing claims, and being subject to jurisdiction in personal capacity;
   
   ii) **Tribal Member Capacity**: As an enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), with rights and protections flowing from tribal citizenship;
   
   iii) **Cultural Representative Capacity**: As a steward of Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions held collectively by the Anishinaabe people, acting to protect cultural heritage on behalf of the broader community;

b) **TRIBAL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY PRESERVED:**
   Nothing in this license constitutes:
   i) An action by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians as a government entity;
   ii) A waiver of GTBOCI sovereign immunity;
   iii) Consent to suit against the tribal government;
   iv) Authorization to sue the tribe for any dispute under this license;
   
   The tribe's sovereign immunity remains absolute under *Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.*, 523 U.S. 751 (1998), and *Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community*, 572 U.S. 782 (2014).

c) **ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS:**
   Enforcement actions under this license shall be brought:
   i) By the Rights Holder in individual capacity, OR
   ii) By successor authorities designated in Section 10.2, OR
   iii) With tribal government approval, by the Grand Traverse Band as a sovereign governmental entity exercising discretion to waive immunity for specific claims;
   
   Users may NOT bring counterclaims or third-party claims against the Grand Traverse Band based on this license. Any attempt to implead or join the tribe is prohibited and void.

d) **RIGHTS HOLDER'S INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY:**
   The Rights Holder acts as an individual licensor and may be subject to jurisdiction in individual capacity for disputes properly arising under this license, subject to:
   i) Forum selection clauses requiring primary tribal court jurisdiction;
   ii) Applicable statute of limitations;
   iii) Due process requirements;
   
   However, the Rights Holder's status as a tribal member and the cultural nature of the Work invoke special protections under federal Indian law as detailed throughout this license.

e) **NO IMPLIED WAIVER:**
   The Rights Holder's agreement to act in individual capacity for certain purposes does NOT waive:
   i) Tribal sovereign immunity for the Grand Traverse Band;
   ii) Treaty rights of the Ottawa and Chippewa peoples;
   iii) Federal trust responsibilities;
   iv) Special protections under federal Indian law;
   v) Tribal court primary jurisdiction;
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Clarifies who can sue and be sued
- Prevents confusion between individual and tribal capacity
- Preserves tribal immunity while allowing individual enforcement
- Prevents attempts to pierce tribal immunity through individual suits

## VI. Conclusion

The current license has a **strong conceptual framework** but lacks **explicit federal Indian law grounding** necessary to withstand sophisticated legal challenges. The recommended amendments:

1. **Anchor the license in treaty rights** - Creates constitutional foundation
2. **Explicitly address Montana** - Protects tribal court jurisdiction
3. **Distinguish helpful from harmful preemption** - Shields from Copyright Act preemption while invoking federal Indian law preemption
4. **Integrate IACA** - Provides independent statutory basis
5. **Clarify Castro-Huerta** - Prevents hostile extension to civil jurisdiction
6. **Separate individual from tribal capacity** - Preserves sovereign immunity

**Risk Reduction:** Implementing these amendments reduces federal Indian law vulnerabilities from **HIGH** to **LOW-MEDIUM**, creating multiple fallback positions and forcing challengers to overcome well-established Supreme Court precedent rather than exploiting gaps in the license language.

**Next Steps:** Review with tribal attorney, then external federal Indian law specialist (recommend contacting Indian Law Resource Center, Native American Rights Fund, or major firm with Indian law practice).
