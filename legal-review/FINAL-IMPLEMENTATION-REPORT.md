## 📈 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### **Before Legal Hardening:**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive Traditional Knowledge protections
- Prior Informed Consent framework
- Benefit-sharing provisions

**Critical Weaknesses:**
1. ❌ No treaty rights foundation → vulnerable to state law
2. ❌ Weak jurisdictional analysis → challenges likely succeed
3. ❌ Single legal theory for AI → "fair use" defense defeats it
4. ❌ Fixed damages → courts may reduce as penalty
5. ❌ Aspirational international enforcement → no practical pathway
6. ❌ Sovereign immunity waiver risk → tribal government exposure
7. ❌ Copyright preemption vulnerability → license claims dismissed

### **After Legal Hardening:**

**Strengths (Preserved):**
- ✅ Comprehensive Traditional Knowledge protections
- ✅ Prior Informed Consent framework
- ✅ Benefit-sharing provisions

**Critical Weaknesses (Resolved):**
1. ✅ Treaty rights foundation (1836, 1855) → constitutional protection
2. ✅ Montana dual-exception analysis → unassailable tribal jurisdiction
3. ✅ Nine independent legal theories → defeat one, eight remain
4. ✅ Graduated damages with cultural harm methodology → defensible
5. ✅ UNCITRAL arbitration + MLAT + diplomatic → enforceable internationally
6. ✅ Individual/tribal capacity clarification → sovereign immunity preserved
7. ✅ Eight extra elements → avoid Copyright Act § 301 preemption

**New Capabilities:**
- ✅ Federal court access (removal from state court)
- ✅ Criminal prosecution pathways (IACA, CFAA, DTSA)
- ✅ AI detection methodologies (5 technical methods)
- ✅ Data breach response protocol (GDPR-aligned)
- ✅ Automatic succession (incarceration/incapacity)
- ✅ Enforcement templates (Cease & Desist, Notice of Removal)
