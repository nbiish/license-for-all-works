# Data Sovereignty & CARE Principles Analysis & Amendments

**Document:** 08-data-sovereignty.md  
**Priority Level:** MEDIUM  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## I. Current License Provisions - Data Sovereignty Framework

### A. CARE Principles Integration (Section 4.1, Lines 444-466)

**Current Language:**
> "This license expressly incorporates and implements the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics)..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Incorporates CARE principles
- ✓ Details each principle (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics)
- ✓ References Global Indigenous Data Alliance
- ⚠ No enforcement mechanisms for CARE compliance
- ⚠ Missing technical implementation requirements
- ⚠ No audit procedures for data governance

### B. Data Governance Framework (Section 4.2, Lines 467-494)

**Current Language:**
> "All data derived from, related to, or generated through interaction with the Work shall be governed according to the following framework..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Data categorization by sensitivity
- ✓ Security controls proportionate to sensitivity
- ✓ Data life cycle governance
- ⚠ Technical standards vague (what encryption? which authentication?)
- ⚠ No specific data governance body designated
- ⚠ Missing data breach response procedures

## II. Critical Data Sovereignty Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability 1: Technical Implementation Standards Missing

**Issue:** Section 4.2(b) requires "security controls proportionate to sensitivity" but doesn't specify technical standards.

**Missing Specifications:**
1. **Encryption:** AES-256? RSA? Which cipher suites?
2. **Authentication:** Multi-factor? Biometric? Certificate-based?
3. **Access Controls:** Role-based (RBAC)? Attribute-based (ABAC)?
4. **Logging:** What events logged? Retention period?

**Current Gap:**
Users and data custodians lack guidance on what "proportionate security" means.

---

### Vulnerability 2: Data Breach Response Procedures Absent

**Issue:** License doesn't address what happens when data breach occurs.

**Critical Questions:**
1. Who must be notified? (Rights Holder, GTBOCI, affected individuals?)
2. What is notification timeline? (24 hours? 72 hours?)
3. What are remediation requirements?
4. What are liability consequences?

**Legal Compliance:**
Most jurisdictions have data breach notification laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, state laws). License should align with or exceed these.

---

### Vulnerability 3: Blockchain Restrictions May Be Overbroad

**Issue:** Section 9.4 prohibits "blockchain applications, cryptocurrency mining, NFT creation" but doesn't distinguish beneficial from harmful uses.

**Potential Beneficial Blockchain Uses:**
1. **Provenance Tracking:** Immutable record of authentic TK/TCE sources
2. **Rights Management:** Smart contracts for automatic benefit-sharing
3. **Authentication:** Verifying authentic vs. appropriated cultural items
4. **Community Governance:** Decentralized decision-making for TK access

**Current Problem:**
Blanket prohibition prevents potentially protective uses of blockchain technology.

   - Presumptively acceptable for authorized uses above
   - Requirements:
     * Rights Holder or tribal authority operates nodes
     * Access controlled by community
     * Can modify/delete data if needed (not truly immutable)
     * Environmentally sustainable consensus (proof-of-stake, proof-of-authority)

d) **NFT FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY BENEFIT:**
   
   If NFTs authorized (requires enhanced PIC):
   
   i) **Creator Control:**
      - Rights Holder approves each NFT mint
      - Rights Holder receives at least 50% of initial sale
      - Ongoing royalties on secondary sales (minimum 20%)

      - Transparent accounting on blockchain
      - Cannot evade benefit-sharing obligations
   
   iv) **Anti-Speculation:**
      - NFTs may include use restrictions (not pure speculation)
      - Could grant specific rights (attendance at event, educational access)
      - De-emphasize investment/speculation framing

e) **ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY:**
   
   All blockchain applications must:
   i) Use energy-efficient consensus (proof-of-stake, proof-of-authority, or equivalent)
   ii) Carbon-neutral or carbon-negative operations
   iii) Annual environmental impact reporting
   iv) Offset environmental harm if any

f) **PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT FOR BLOCKCHAIN:**
   
   PIC for blockchain applications must include:
   i) Plain-language explanation of blockchain technology
   ii) Specific use case and purpose
   iii) Privacy and immutability implications
   iv) Environmental impact
   v) Benefit-sharing structure
   vi) Community control mechanisms
   vii) Exit strategy if harmful

g) **VIOLATIONS:**
   
   Unauthorized blockchain use violates this license:
   i) Subject to graduated damages per Section 13.1
   ii) Blockchain-specific relief:
      - Burning/destroying tokens
      - Transferring NFT ownership to Rights Holder
      - Forfeiting cryptocurrency proceeds
      - Deleting on-chain metadata (if permissioned blockchain)
   iii) Criminal referrals for cryptocurrency fraud where applicable
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Distinguishes harmful speculation from beneficial uses
- Preserves Rights Holder control while allowing innovation
- Addresses environmental concerns
- Creates framework for community-beneficial NFTs
- Requires permissioned blockchains for most uses
- Maintains inalienability and benefit-sharing principles
