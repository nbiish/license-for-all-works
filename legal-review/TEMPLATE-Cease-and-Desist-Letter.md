**[Violator Address]**  
**[City, State ZIP]**

**RE: FINAL DEMAND - Imminent Litigation for License Violation**  
**Work:** [Title of Work]  
**Prior Notice:** [Date of Tier 1 letter]  
**Violation Continuing Since:** [Date]

Dear [Name/Sir or Madam]:

This is the **FINAL DEMAND** before litigation.

**1. NO RESPONSE TO PRIOR NOTICE**

On [DATE], we sent you a cease and desist letter regarding your violation of the license governing use of [WORK TITLE]. You have failed to:
- Respond to our communication
- Cease the violative conduct
- Remove infringing materials
- Remit the good faith settlement payment

The violation continues as of this date, demonstrating **willful disregard** of our client's intellectual property rights and tribal sovereignty.

**2. ENHANCED DAMAGES DUE TO WILLFULNESS**

Your failure to cure after notice establishes **willfulness** under Section 12.5(h) of the license, triggering:

- **Doubling of all damages** (base + cultural + economic)
- **Punitive damages** up to 3x doubled amount
- **Mandatory attorney fees** with no judicial discretion
- **Criminal referrals** for IACA, CFAA, and DTSA violations
- **Enhanced cultural harm multiplier** (3x) for willful violations of sacred content

**Estimated Total Liability:** $[CALCULATE per Section 12.5]

**Breakdown:**
- Base Liquidated Damages: $[AMOUNT]
- Cultural Harm Multiplier (willful): × [MULTIPLIER]
- Actual Economic Damages: $[AMOUNT]
- Attorney Fees (to date): $[AMOUNT]
- **TOTAL:** $[AMOUNT]

**3. FINAL SETTLEMENT OFFER (72 Hours)**

To avoid immediate litigation and potential six-figure liability, we offer one final settlement:

- **Full release** of claims (except for future violations)
- **Attorney's fees** included in settlement (no additional fees)

This offer expires in **72 hours**. After expiration, no further settlement discussions will occur pre-trial.

- **Immediate removal** to federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441
- **Transfer/dismissal** to tribal court under exhaustion doctrine
