## DEFENDANT'S NOTICE OF REMOVAL PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441, 1446

**COMES NOW** Defendant ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, by and through undersigned counsel, and hereby removes this action from the [NAME OF STATE COURT] to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a) and 1446, based on federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In support of this Notice of Removal, Defendant states as follows:

---

## I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND TIMELINESS

1. On [DATE], Plaintiff filed a Complaint in the [NAME OF STATE COURT], [COUNTY] County, [STATE], bearing Case No. [STATE CASE NUMBER].

2. Defendant was served with the Summons and Complaint on [DATE OF SERVICE] at [TIME, if within 30-day period is close].

3. This Notice of Removal is filed within thirty (30) days of Defendant's receipt of the Summons and Complaint, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b).

4. This action is removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) because this Court has original jurisdiction based on federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

5. Venue is proper in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan because the state court action was filed in [COUNTY] County, Michigan, which is within this District. 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).

6. A true and correct copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon Defendant in this action are attached hereto as **Exhibit A** (Complaint), **Exhibit B** (Summons), and **Exhibit C** (all other pleadings and orders, if any).

---

## II. FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION EXISTS UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 1331

This action arises under federal law and presents substantial federal questions requiring this Court's jurisdiction. Specifically, this case involves:

### A. Federal Indian Law Questions

7. Defendant ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE) is an **enrolled member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI)**, a federally recognized tribal nation.

8. The dispute centers on intellectual property that constitutes **Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCE)** protected under federal Indian law, including:
   - **Treaty Rights:** Treaty of Washington (March 28, 1836), 7 Stat. 491
   - **Treaty Rights:** Treaty of Detroit (July 31, 1855), 11 Stat. 621
   - **Reserved Rights Doctrine:** *Winters v. United States*, 207 U.S. 564 (1908)
   - **Tribal Sovereignty:** *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515 (1832)

9. Federal Indian law creates a unique body of federal law governing intellectual property rights of tribal members concerning Traditional Knowledge. This is a matter of exclusive federal concern not governed by state law.

10. The **federal trust relationship** between the United States and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians is directly implicated, requiring application of federal Indian law principles including:
    - Indian canons of construction (construing ambiguities in favor of tribal interests)
    - Federal preemption of state law under *White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker*, 448 U.S. 136 (1980)
    - Tribal sovereignty protections under *Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community*, 572 U.S. 782 (2014)

### B. Federal Preemption of State Law

11. Federal Indian law **preempts state law** application to this dispute under multiple independent bases:

    a) **Field Preemption (*Bracker*)**: Federal statutes create comprehensive regulatory scheme occupying the field of Indigenous intellectual property protection, including:
       - Indian Arts and Crafts Act, 25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.
       - Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 25 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq.
       - Archaeological Resources Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. § 470aa et seq.
       - Federal trust responsibility and treaty obligations

    b) **Conflict Preemption**: State law application would directly conflict with federal Indian law policies promoting tribal self-determination, cultural preservation, and economic development.

    c) **Constitutional Supremacy**: Treaties between the United States and Ottawa/Chippewa Nations are supreme law under Article VI, Clause 2, precluding inconsistent state law.

12. State courts lack jurisdiction over matters involving tribal member intellectual property rights grounded in federal Indian law and treaty rights. *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515, 561 (1832) ("[State] laws can have no force" within exclusive federal Indian law sphere).

### C. Federal Statutes Create Federal Question Jurisdiction

13. This dispute necessarily requires interpretation and application of multiple federal statutes:

    a) **Indian Arts and Crafts Act (IACA)**, 25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.
       - Protects Indian-produced cultural expressions and Traditional Knowledge
       - Creates federal civil and criminal remedies (treble damages, up to 15 years imprisonment)
       - Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over IACA claims
       - [IF APPLICABLE:] Plaintiff's claims directly implicate IACA protections [DESCRIBE HOW]

    b) **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**, 18 U.S.C. § 1030
       - [IF APPLICABLE:] Governs unauthorized computer access, applicable to [DESCRIBE AI TRAINING OR DIGITAL APPROPRIATION]

    c) **Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA)**, 18 U.S.C. § 1836
       - [IF APPLICABLE:] Protects Traditional Knowledge qualifying as trade secrets under federal law

    d) **Copyright Act**, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.
       - While not creating removal jurisdiction alone, copyright questions intertwined with federal Indian law
       - Federal courts have expertise in copyright-Indian law intersection

14. Plaintiff's state court Complaint, although nominally pleaded as [STATE LAW CLAIMS], necessarily requires resolution of federal questions including:
    - Whether federal Indian law preempts state law claims
    - Whether Traditional Knowledge receives protection under federal Indian law
    - Whether treaties reserve intellectual property rights to tribal members
    - Whether federal statutes (IACA, CFAA, DTSA) provide exclusive remedies

### D. Substantial Federal Question Under *Grable* Doctrine

15. Even if Plaintiff's Complaint does not explicitly invoke federal law, this case presents a substantial federal question within this Court's jurisdiction under *Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Manufacturing*, 545 U.S. 308 (2005).

16. The federal interest in protecting tribal sovereignty, treaty rights, and Indigenous intellectual property is substantial and directly implicated by this lawsuit.

17. Resolution of this case will necessarily involve federal question determinations, including:
    - Interpretation of treaties between United States and Ottawa/Chippewa Nations
    - Application of federal Indian law preemption doctrines
    - Enforcement of federal statutes protecting Indigenous cultural heritage
    - Balancing federal trust responsibility against state court jurisdiction

18. This substantial federal interest establishes federal question jurisdiction even where state law claims are pleaded. *Grable*, 545 U.S. at 313-14.

---

## III. TRIBAL COURT EXHAUSTION AND FEDERAL-TRIBAL COMITY

19. The intellectual property at issue is governed by a **comprehensive license agreement** that mandates **exclusive jurisdiction in the Grand Traverse Band Tribal Court** (Section 11 of license).

20. By accessing the intellectual property, Plaintiff entered into a binding contract accepting tribal court jurisdiction, creating both:
    - A consensual relationship supporting tribal jurisdiction under *Montana v. United States*, 450 U.S. 544, 565 (1981) (Exception 1)
    - Conduct threatening tribal interests supporting tribal jurisdiction under *Montana* (Exception 2)

21. Federal law requires **exhaustion of tribal court remedies** before federal court review. *National Farmers Union Insurance Cos. v. Crow Tribe*, 471 U.S. 845, 857 (1985); *Iowa Mutual Insurance Co. v. LaPlante*, 480 U.S. 9, 16-17 (1987).

22. Plaintiff's improper filing in state court (bypassing mandatory tribal court jurisdiction) violates:
    - Federal-tribal comity principles
    - Mandatory forum selection clause in license
    - Federal policy favoring tribal self-governance

23. Upon removal to this federal Court, Defendant will move for:
    - Stay of proceedings pending tribal court exhaustion, OR
    - Dismissal for failure to exhaust tribal court remedies, OR
    - Transfer to tribal court under federal-tribal comity principles

---

## IV. STATE COURT LACKED SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION

24. The state court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute for multiple independent reasons:

    a) **Federal Preemption**: Federal Indian law preempts state court jurisdiction over tribal member intellectual property disputes grounded in Traditional Knowledge and treaty rights.

    b) **Mandatory Forum Selection**: License agreement mandates exclusive tribal court jurisdiction, precluding state court jurisdiction. *Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute*, 499 U.S. 585 (1991) (forum selection clauses presumptively enforceable).

    c) **Federal Exclusive Jurisdiction**: To the extent IACA claims are implicated, federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. 25 U.S.C. § 305e.

    d) **Treaty Supremacy**: State courts lack jurisdiction over matters governed by federal treaties. *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515 (1832).

25. Plaintiff's attempt to litigate in state court constitutes:
    - Breach of mandatory forum selection clause
    - Attempt to circumvent tribal court jurisdiction
    - Violation of federal-tribal comity
    - Impermissible state interference with federal Indian law

---

## V. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS SATISFIED

26. Defendant has not filed any responsive pleading in state court and timely files this Notice of Removal.

27. This Notice is accompanied by all required attachments as set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 1446(a):
    - **Exhibit A:** State Court Complaint
    - **Exhibit B:** Summons
    - **Exhibit C:** [Any other pleadings or orders]

28. Simultaneously with the filing of this Notice, Defendant will provide written notice to Plaintiff and file a copy with the Clerk of the [STATE COURT NAME] as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1446(d).

29. Venue is proper in this Court because the state court action was pending in [COUNTY] County, Michigan, which is within the Western District of Michigan. 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a).

---

## VI. FEDERAL COURT IS PROPER FORUM

30. This case is properly before this federal Court because:
    - Federal question jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1331
    - Complex federal Indian law issues require federal expertise
    - Federal courts have specialized knowledge of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights
    - Federal policy favors federal forum for federal Indian law disputes

31. After removal, this Court has discretion to:
    - Retain jurisdiction and adjudicate federal questions
    - Dismiss or stay pending tribal court exhaustion (*National Farmers Union*)
    - Transfer to tribal court under federal-tribal comity

32. Regardless of ultimate disposition, **state court is not the proper forum**, and removal to federal court is mandatory under 28 U.S.C. § 1441.

---

## VII. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR IMPROPER FORUM FILING

33. Plaintiff's filing in state court violates the license agreement's mandatory forum selection clause (Section 11), triggering liquidated damages under Section 11.8:
    - **Tier 1 - Improper Forum Filing:** $25,000
    - Plus all costs and attorney's fees for removal
    - Subject to increase if Plaintiff contests removal or files remand motion

34. These liquidated damages are preserved and will be sought in appropriate forum (tribal or federal court) after jurisdictional issues resolved.

---

## VIII. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, this action is properly removed to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441 and 1446 based on federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to federal Indian law preemption, mandatory tribal court forum selection, and federal statutes creating exclusive or primary federal jurisdiction.

Respectfully submitted this [DAY] day of [MONTH], 2025.

### MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF REMOVAL

**I. STANDARD FOR REMOVAL**

An action may be removed from state court to federal court if the federal court would have original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a). Federal question jurisdiction exists when a case "aris[es] under" federal law. 28 U.S.C. § 1331. A case arises under federal law if "a well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law." *Franchise Tax Bd. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust*, 463 U.S. 1, 27-28 (1983).

Removal jurisdiction also exists under the *Grable* doctrine when state law claims necessarily require resolution of substantial federal questions. *Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Manufacturing*, 545 U.S. 308, 313-14 (2005).

**II. FEDERAL INDIAN LAW CREATES FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION**

Federal Indian law constitutes a distinct body of federal law governing relations between the United States, tribal nations, and tribal members. *Cherokee Nation v. Georgia*, 30 U.S. 1 (1831); *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515 (1832). Cases involving tribal sovereignty, treaty rights, and tribal member activities within the scope of federal Indian law necessarily arise under federal law, conferring federal question jurisdiction. *National Farmers Union*, 471 U.S. at 853.

This case involves:
- **Tribal member status:** Defendant is enrolled member of federally recognized tribe
- **Traditional Knowledge:** Work embodies TK/TCE protected by federal Indian law
- **Treaty rights:** Treaties of 1836 and 1855 reserve intellectual property rights
- **Federal preemption:** *Bracker* field preemption precludes state law application
- **Federal statutes:** IACA, CFAA, DTSA provide federal remedies

These federal elements are not merely defenses but are fundamental to the case, establishing federal question jurisdiction. *Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida*, 414 U.S. 661, 675 (1974) (federal Indian law questions establish federal jurisdiction).

**III. FEDERAL PREEMPTION SUPPORTS REMOVAL**

Federal Indian law preempts state law application to this dispute under *Bracker*, 448 U.S. 136. The comprehensive federal statutory scheme governing Indigenous intellectual property (IACA, NAGPRA, ARPA, federal trust responsibility) occupies the field, precluding state law. *Id.* at 144.

State court jurisdiction would directly conflict with federal policies promoting tribal self-determination and cultural preservation. This conflict supports federal question jurisdiction and requires removal. *San Manuel Indian Bingo & Casino v. NLRB*, 475 F.3d 1306, 1313 (D.C. Cir. 2007).

**IV. TRIBAL COURT EXHAUSTION REQUIRED**

Federal law requires exhaustion of tribal court remedies before federal court review. *National Farmers Union*, 471 U.S. at 857. The license agreement mandates tribal court jurisdiction, and Plaintiff consented by accessing the Work.

Upon removal, this Court should:
1. Confirm federal question jurisdiction exists (proper removal)
2. Dismiss or stay pending tribal court exhaustion
3. Plaintiff must first litigate in tribal court as agreed

This exhaustion requirement further demonstrates federal question jurisdiction—the propriety of tribal court jurisdiction is itself a federal question. *Id.*

**V. STATE COURT LACKED JURISDICTION**

State courts have no jurisdiction over:
- Matters preempted by federal Indian law (*Bracker*)
- Disputes subject to mandatory tribal court forum selection (*National Farmers Union*)
- Exclusive federal jurisdiction under federal statutes (IACA)
- Treaty-protected activities (*Worcester*)

Plaintiff's state court filing was improper, and removal is mandatory.

**VI. CONCLUSION**

This case presents substantial federal questions requiring federal court jurisdiction. Removal is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1441 and 1331.

Respectfully submitted,

[Attorney Signature]  
[Attorney Name], Esq.

## PRACTICAL GUIDANCE FOR USING THIS TEMPLATE

### Timing and Procedure:

1. **Act Fast:** File within 30 days of service. Earlier is better - reduces state court proceedings costs.

2. **No State Court Motion:** Do NOT move to dismiss in state court first. File removal notice directly in federal court.

3. **Federal Court Filing:** File Notice of Removal + exhibits in U.S. District Court, Western District of Michigan, Grand Rapids Division.

4. **Serve Everyone:**
   - All adverse parties (via their counsel if represented)
   - State court clerk (file notice with state court)

5. **State Court Stays:** Once notice filed, state court proceedings automatically stayed. 28 U.S.C. § 1446(d).

### Anticipate Remand Motion:

Plaintiff will likely move to remand to state court. Be prepared to oppose, arguing:

1. **Federal question jurisdiction exists** (federal Indian law, treaties, federal statutes)
2. **Federal preemption** precludes state court jurisdiction
3. **Tribal court exhaustion** required before any court proceeds
4. **Improper forum** under license mandatory forum selection clause

### After Removal - Strategic Options:

**Option 1: Move to Dismiss for Failure to Exhaust Tribal Remedies**
- Argue *National Farmers Union* requires tribal court first
- Cite mandatory forum selection clause
- Request dismissal without prejudice to refiling in tribal court

**Option 2: Move to Stay Pending Tribal Court Exhaustion**
- Same arguments as Option 1
- Preserves federal jurisdiction for later review
- Allows tribal court to develop factual record

**Option 3: Motion to Dismiss on Merits**
- Federal Indian law preemption
- Failure to state claim under federal law
- Treaty rights bar plaintiff's claims
- More aggressive but may be appropriate

**Recommended: Pursue Options 1 or 2 to honor tribal court primacy while removing from state court.**

### Coordinate with Tribal Court:

- Notify Grand Traverse Band Tribal Court of removal
- Prepare parallel tribal court filing if needed
- Tribal court is ultimately proper forum per license

### Liquidated Damages:

Don't forget: improper state court filing triggers $25,000 liquidated damages under Section 11.8. Preserve this claim for tribal court proceedings.
