# International Treaty Framework Analysis & Amendments

**Document:** 02-international-treaties.md  
**Priority Level:** HIGH  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## I. Current License Provisions - International Framework

### A. WIPO Treaty References (Lines 9-21)

**Current Language:**
> "In accordance with the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 24, 2024, with 8 ratifications as of July 2025, pending entry into force upon 15 member state ratifications)..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Correctly identifies WIPO Treaty adoption date (May 24, 2024)
- ✓ Notes ratification threshold (15 member states required)
- ✓ Tracks ratification progress (8 as of July 2025)
- ⚠ Does NOT provide mechanism for enforcement before entry into force
- ⚠ Lacks specific citation to WIPO Treaty articles
- ⚠ No procedure for automatic incorporation upon entry into force

### B. UNDRIP Integration (Lines 442-443)

**Current Language:**
> "Furthermore, no rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11... and 31..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Invokes UNDRIP Articles 11 and 31
- ✓ Declares no waiver of UNDRIP rights
- ⚠ UNDRIP is a Declaration, not a treaty - legally non-binding in most jurisdictions
- ⚠ Does NOT cite binding regional instruments (American Declaration on Indigenous Peoples' Rights)
- ⚠ Lacks enforcement mechanism for UNDRIP violations

### C. International Enforcement (Section 12.3, Lines 96-104)

**Current Language:**
> "For international disputes, this license invokes the protections of UNDRIP, the WIPO Treaty on Traditional Knowledge, and other international instruments protecting Indigenous rights."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Mentions WIPO arbitration possibility
- ✓ References New York Convention
- ⚠ No specific UNCITRAL procedural rules specified
- ⚠ Missing MLAT invocation procedures
- ⚠ No bilateral treaty identification
- ⚠ Unclear arbitration seat and governing law
- ⚠ No enforcement mechanism for arbitral awards

### D. Cross-Border Enforcement (Section 12.3A, Lines 98-104)

**Current Language:**
> "CROSS-BORDER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS: To strengthen international enforcement of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Mentions MLATs conceptually
- ✓ References asset freezing and extradition
- ✓ Invokes diplomatic enforcement
- ✗ Completely lacks procedural details for any mechanism
- ✗ No identification of which MLATs apply
- ✗ No diplomatic escalation protocol
- ✗ Extradition requires criminal conduct - unclear when applicable

## II. Critical International Law Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability 1: WIPO Treaty Not Yet In Force

**Issue:** The WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 24, 2024) requires 15 ratifications to enter into force. As of July 2025, only 8 ratifications exist.

**WIPO Treaty Timeline:**
- Adopted by Diplomatic Conference: May 24, 2024
- Opened for Signature: Not yet (will open after diplomatic processing)
- Entry into Force: Three months after 15th ratification
- Current Status (July 2025): 8 ratifications
- Estimated Entry into Force: Late 2025 to 2026

**Why This Matters:**
Until the WIPO Treaty enters into force, it creates **no binding international legal obligations**. It cannot be invoked in international courts, arbitration, or domestic litigation as a source of rights or obligations.

**Current Risk:**
The license treats WIPO Treaty as currently enforceable, but international courts/arbitrators will not apply it until entry into force. This creates a **2-3 year enforcement gap**.

**Mitigation Required:**
Need alternative international legal basis during gap period (UNDRIP regional analogs, customary international law, existing IP treaties).

---

### Vulnerability 2: UNDRIP Non-Binding Status

**Issue:** UNDRIP is a **Declaration**, not a treaty. It is **not legally binding** under international law in most circumstances.

**Legal Status of UNDRIP:**
- Adopted by UN General Assembly: September 13, 2007
- Vote: 144 in favor, 4 against (US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand - all later endorsed)
- Legal Character: **General Assembly Declaration** = aspirational, not binding
- Customary International Law Status: Debated; some articles may reflect custom
- Domestic Effect: Varies by country; US has not enacted implementing legislation

**UNDRIP in US Domestic Law:**
- US endorsed UNDRIP in 2010 (Obama administration)
- Endorsement was **explicitly non-binding** and "aspirational"
- Courts have **not** treated UNDRIP as directly enforceable law
- Some recent cases cite UNDRIP persuasively, but it creates no private right of action

**Why This Matters:**
- US federal courts will not enforce UNDRIP as binding law
- International arbitrators may cite UNDRIP as context but cannot base awards solely on it
- Foreign courts vary in UNDRIP treatment

**Current Risk:**
License relies heavily on UNDRIP but provides no enforcement mechanism for a non-binding declaration.

---

### Vulnerability 3: Missing Regional Binding Instruments

**Issue:** While UNDRIP is non-binding, several **regional instruments** ARE binding but are not referenced in the license:

#### A. American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2016)

**Status:** Adopted by Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly, June 15, 2016

**Key Provisions:**
- Article XIII: Right to collective intellectual property over traditional knowledge
- Article XIV: Right to develop and maintain cultural identity
- Article XXIX: Right to property and control over lands and resources
- Article XXI: Right to maintain and develop knowledge systems

**Why It Matters:**
- Covers all OAS member states (35 countries in Americas)
- Creates regional human rights obligations
- May be enforceable through Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
- Binding on US as OAS member (debated)

**Current License:** Does NOT cite American Declaration

---

#### B. ILO Convention 169 (Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989)

**Status:** International Labour Organization treaty; 24 ratifications

**Key Provisions:**
- Article 13: Recognition of spiritual relationship to lands
- Article 15: Rights to natural resources and traditional knowledge
- Article 30: Measures to preserve indigenous cultures

**Why It Matters:**
- **Binding treaty** on ratifying states (unlike UNDRIP)
- Includes Latin American countries where enforcement may be sought
- Creates international legal obligations

**US Status:** NOT ratified by US

**Current License:** Does NOT cite ILO 169

---

#### C. Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing (2010)

**Status:** Protocol to Convention on Biological Diversity; entered into force Oct 12, 2014; 138 parties

**Key Provisions:**
- Article 5: Fair and equitable benefit-sharing from genetic resources
- Article 7: Traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources
- Article 12: Traditional knowledge benefit-sharing obligations
- Article 16: Compliance mechanisms

**Why It Matters:**
- **Binding treaty** on parties
- Directly addresses benefit-sharing from traditional knowledge
- Establishes minimum 20% benefit-sharing in some implementations

**US Status:** NOT party to Nagoya Protocol (not party to CBD)

**Current License:** Does NOT cite Nagoya Protocol, though license requires 20% benefit-sharing similar to Nagoya

---

### Vulnerability 4: No UNCITRAL Arbitration Procedure Specified

**Issue:** License mentions UNCITRAL arbitration (Line 103) but provides no procedural specifications required for enforceable arbitration.

**Required Elements for Enforceable Arbitration:**
1. **Arbitration Seat:** Physical location/legal jurisdiction governing arbitration
2. **Governing Law:** Substantive law to apply to merits
3. **Procedural Rules:** UNCITRAL Rules, ICC Rules, etc.
4. **Number of Arbitrators:** 1 or 3
5. **Arbitrator Selection Process:** How are arbitrators appointed?
6. **Language of Arbitration:** English? Multiple languages?
7. **Allocation of Costs:** Who pays arbitration fees?

**Current License:** Specifies **none of the above**.

**Why This Matters:**
Without complete arbitration clause, parties may dispute:
- Whether arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable
- Which procedural rules apply
- Where arbitration should be held
- How arbitrators are selected

This delays enforcement by 1-2 years while procedural disputes are resolved.

**New York Convention Requirement:**
To enforce arbitral award under New York Convention (1958), must have valid arbitration agreement meeting Convention requirements. Incomplete clauses may be found unenforceable.

---

### Vulnerability 5: MLAT Procedures Undefined

**Issue:** License references Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) but provides no invocation procedures.

**What MLATs Do:**
MLATs are bilateral/multilateral treaties allowing governments to request assistance in:
- Criminal investigations
- Evidence gathering
- Asset freezing/forfeiture
- Service of process
- Witness testimony

**Critical Limitation:**
MLATs are **government-to-government** instruments. Private parties **cannot directly invoke MLATs**.

**Invocation Process:**
1. Private party reports crime to domestic law enforcement
2. Domestic prosecutor investigates and determines criminal prosecution warranted
3. Prosecutor requests assistance through MLAT channels (typically DOJ Office of International Affairs)
4. Request sent to foreign central authority
5. Foreign government executes request under its domestic law

**Timeline:** 6 months to 2+ years

**Why This Matters:**
License suggests Rights Holder can invoke MLATs directly. This is **legally impossible**. MLATs can only be invoked by:
- U.S. Department of Justice
- Foreign government authorities
- Law enforcement agencies

**Current Risk:**
License creates false expectation of MLAT availability for civil IP disputes. MLATs generally require criminal conduct.

---

### Vulnerability 6: Diplomatic Enforcement Undefined

**Issue:** License references "diplomatic enforcement" (Line 102) but provides no mechanism.

**Government-to-Government Relationships:**
- Tribal nations have government-to-government relationships with US federal government
- US conducts foreign relations with other nations
- Tribes do NOT have direct diplomatic relations with foreign nations
- Foreign nations recognize US federal government, not individual tribes

**Diplomatic Escalation Paths:**
1. **Through US Federal Government:**
   - Tribe → BIA → State Department → Foreign Nation
   - Requires federal government willingness to intervene
   - US discretion whether to pursue

2. **Through UN Mechanisms:**
   - UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (advisory only)
   - UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Rights (investigates, reports, recommends)
   - Human Rights Council (political pressure)
   - None create binding legal obligations

3. **Through Indigenous International Networks:**
   - International Indian Treaty Council (observer status at UN)
   - Coordination with indigenous peoples in other countries
   - Political/media pressure

**Why This Matters:**
"Diplomatic enforcement" sounds powerful but has no legal mechanism without US federal government cooperation, which is **discretionary**.

**Current Risk:**
License overstates enforceability of diplomatic measures.

---

### Vulnerability 7: New York Convention Gaps

**Issue:** License references New York Convention for recognizing arbitral awards but lacks implementation details.

**New York Convention (1958):**
- **Full Name:** Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards
- **Parties:** 172 countries (including US)
- **Purpose:** Enforce arbitral awards across borders
- **Requirement:** Valid arbitration agreement under Convention Article II

**Article II Requirements:**
1. Agreement in writing
2. Defined legal relationship (contractual or non-contractual)
3. Capable of settlement by arbitration
4. Subject matter arbitrable under domestic law

**US Implementation:**
- 9 U.S.C. §§ 201-208 (Federal Arbitration Act Chapter 2)
- Federal courts have jurisdiction to confirm and enforce
- Limited grounds for refusal (public policy, due process, arbitrability)

**Current License:**
- ✓ References New York Convention (Line 96)
- ✗ Does NOT specify arbitration agreement complying with Article II
- ✗ Unclear which disputes subject to arbitration vs. litigation
- ✗ No procedural specifications required for Article II compliance

**Why This Matters:**
If arbitration clause does not meet New York Convention requirements, arbitral award may not be enforceable in 172 countries - defeating entire purpose of international arbitration.

---

## III. International Legal Instruments Analysis

### A. WIPO Treaty on IP, Genetic Resources and Associated TK

**Official Name:** WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge

**Adoption:** Diplomatic Conference, Geneva, May 13-24, 2024

**Key Provisions Relevant to License:**

#### Article 3: Disclosure Requirement

**Text (Paraphrased):**
> Where a claimed invention in a patent application is based on genetic resources and/or associated traditional knowledge, applicant shall disclose:
> - Country providing genetic resources
> - Indigenous peoples or local community providing traditional knowledge
> - Source of genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge

**Benefit to License:**
Once in force, patent applicants using TK from this Work MUST disclose source or face sanctions. Creates defensive protection.

**Current License:** ✓ References this at Lines 11-21

---

#### Article 5: Consequences of Non-Disclosure

**Text (Paraphrased):**
> Contracting Parties shall provide for remedies in case of failure to disclose, including:
> - Patent revocation or invalidation
> - Prevention of patent enforcement
> - Other meaningful remedies

**Benefit to License:**
Creates enforcement mechanism against patents improperly appropriating TK.

**Current License:** ⚠ Does NOT explicitly reference Article 5 remedies

---

#### Article 7: Cross-Border Cooperation

**Text (Paraphrased):**
> Contracting Parties shall cooperate to facilitate access to information about genetic resources and traditional knowledge.

**Benefit to License:**
Could facilitate tracking misappropriated TK across borders.

**Current License:** ⚠ Does NOT reference cross-border cooperation provisions

---

**WIPO Treaty Current Status (January 2025):**
- Ratifications: 8+ (as of July 2025 per license)
- Needed: 15 ratifications
- Expected Entry into Force: Late 2025 / Early 2026
- US Position: Under consideration; no ratification yet

**Amendment Needed:**
License should provide for automatic incorporation of WIPO Treaty provisions upon entry into force.

---

### B. United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

**Adoption:** UN General Assembly Resolution 61/295, September 13, 2007

**Key Articles for License:**

#### Article 11 (Cultural Rights)

**Text:**
> "1. Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature."

**Application:** Protects right to control TCEs in this license

---

#### Article 12 (Sacred Sites & Ceremonies)

**Text:**
> "1. Indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies; the right to maintain, protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites..."

**Application:** Protects sacred sites (Beaver Island stone circle, Garden Island burial grounds)

---

#### Article 31 (IP Rights)

**Text:**
> "1. Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.
> 2. In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights."

**Application:** Core foundation for TK/TCE protections in license

---

**US Position on UNDRIP:**
- 2010: US announced support (Obama administration)
- Statement: Support is "aspirational" and "not legally binding"
- No implementing legislation passed
- Federal agencies issued guidance on UNDRIP considerations
- Courts cite UNDRIP as interpretive guide but not binding law

**Limitation:**
UNDRIP creates **political and moral obligations** but not enforceable legal rights in US courts.

---

### C. American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

**Adoption:** OAS General Assembly AG/RES. 2888 (XLVI-O/16), June 15, 2016

**Legal Status:** Adopted by OAS member states; binding force debated

**Key Articles for License:**

#### Article XIII (Intellectual Property)

**Text (Paraphrased):**
> Indigenous peoples have the right to protection of their cultural and intellectual property, including collective intellectual property over traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, designs, and spiritual practices.

**Benefit:** More specific IP protection than UNDRIP

---

#### Article XXI (Autonomy and Self-Government)

**Text (Paraphrased):**
> Indigenous peoples have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, including intellectual and cultural heritage.

**Benefit:** Supports tribal court jurisdiction over IP disputes

---

#### Article XXIX (Property Rights)

**Text (Paraphrased):**
> Indigenous peoples have the right to the recognition, observance and enforcement of treaties and other constructive arrangements with states.

**Benefit:** Reinforces treaty rights foundation (1836, 1855 treaties)

---

**US Position:**
US voted in favor of American Declaration in 2016. However, like UNDRIP, its binding force in US domestic courts is unclear.

**Amendment Opportunity:**
License should cite American Declaration to show regional consensus beyond global UNDRIP.

---

## IV. Recommended International Treaty Amendments

### Amendment 1: WIPO Treaty Automatic Incorporation (CRITICAL)

**Insert After Section 9-21 (Current WIPO Treaty Language), Add:**

```markdown
**WIPO TREATY IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING**

a) **AUTOMATIC INCORPORATION UPON ENTRY INTO FORCE:**
   Upon entry into force of the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (requiring 15 ratifications), all provisions of that treaty shall be automatically incorporated into and made enforceable under this license without need for amendment, including:
   
   i) Article 3 disclosure requirements for patent applications;
   ii) Article 5 remedies for non-disclosure (patent invalidation, enforcement prevention);
   iii) Article 7 cross-border cooperation provisions;
   iv) All other applicable provisions protecting traditional knowledge and genetic resources;

b) **PRE-ENTRY INTO FORCE OBLIGATIONS:**
   During the period between this license's effective date and the WIPO Treaty's entry into force, users agree to comply with WIPO Treaty provisions as contractual obligations under this license, treating the treaty as incorporated by reference even before its formal entry into force in international law. This creates:
   
   i) **Contractual Disclosure Obligation**: Users seeking patents must disclose TK sources as if WIPO Treaty were in force;
   ii) **Early Compliance Benefit**: Users complying pre-entry will have established good faith and documentation;
   iii) **Penalty for Non-Compliance**: Violation of pre-entry disclosure obligations triggers full license remedies;

c) **RATIFICATION MONITORING:**
   The Rights Holder, successor authorities, and designated financial institutions (Section 9A.7) shall monitor WIPO Treaty ratification status through:
   
   i) WIPO website: https://www.wipo.int/treaties/
   ii) Notifications from World Intellectual Property Organization
   iii) Legal counsel tracking international IP developments
   
   Upon confirmation of 15th ratification, rights holders shall publish notice of WIPO Treaty entry into force and its automatic incorporation into this license.

d) **ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT POST-ENTRY:**
   After WIPO Treaty entry into force, violations shall be subject to:
   
   i) Remedies under this license (Sections 13, 14);
   ii) Remedies under WIPO Treaty Article 5 in ratifying countries;
   iii) Patent invalidation actions in countries implementing disclosure requirements;
   iv) International arbitration invoking WIPO Treaty obligations;
   v) Diplomatic protests for violations by ratifying country nationals;

e) **US RATIFICATION CONTINGENCIES:**
   If the United States ratifies the WIPO Treaty:
   i) All provisions become federal law subject to Supremacy Clause;
   ii) Federal courts must enforce disclosure requirements;
   iii) USPTO must implement disclosure regulations;
   iv) Creates federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331;
   
   If the United States does NOT ratify:
   i) Contractual incorporation remains effective;
   ii) Can seek enforcement in ratifying countries;
   iii) Can use treaty as evidence of international norms in US litigation;
   iv) Diplomatic pressure through countries that have ratified;
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Ensures WIPO Treaty benefits even before international entry into force
- Creates enforceable contractual obligations
- Provides monitoring and notice procedures
- Addresses US ratification and non-ratification scenarios

---

### Amendment 2: Complete UNCITRAL Arbitration Clause (CRITICAL)

**Insert After Section 12.3 (International Enforcement), Replace Lines 96-104 With:**

```markdown
**12.3 INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION UNDER UNCITRAL RULES**

For disputes involving international parties where tribal court jurisdiction is unavailable or enforcement would be sought in multiple foreign jurisdictions, the parties may elect (or the Rights Holder may require) arbitration under the following terms:

a) **ARBITRATION FRAMEWORK:**
   i) **Procedural Rules**: UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as revised in 2013, or as subsequently amended)
   ii) **Arbitral Seat**: Geneva, Switzerland (neutral jurisdiction with strong arbitration law)
   iii) **Alternative Seats**: If Geneva unavailable: The Hague, Netherlands; Ottawa, Canada; or Washington, DC, USA
   iv) **Governing Law**: Federal Indian law and international Indigenous rights law, supplemented by substantive international IP law
   v) **Number of Arbitrators**: Three (3), unless parties agree to sole arbitrator
   vi) **Language**: English, with translation services for Indigenous languages as needed

b) **ARBITRATOR SELECTION:**
   i) **Qualifications Required**: Arbitrators must have demonstrated expertise in at least two of the following: federal Indian law, international Indigenous rights law, intellectual property law, traditional knowledge protection, international arbitration
   ii) **Appointment Process**: 
       (1) Each party appoints one arbitrator within 30 days of arbitration notice;
       (2) Two appointed arbitrators select chair within 30 days;
       (3) If appointment fails, Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at The Hague shall appoint;
   iii) **Indigenous Representation**: At least one arbitrator must have expertise in Indigenous legal systems and traditional knowledge protection; preference for Indigenous arbitrators
   iv) **Disqualification**: Arbitrators with conflicts of interest under IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration are disqualified

c) **SCOPE OF ARBITRATION:**
   Arbitrable disputes include:
   i) Disputes with international parties outside US tribal court jurisdiction
   ii) Enforcement actions requiring international asset recovery
   iii) Multi-jurisdictional intellectual property disputes
   iv) Claims under WIPO Treaty (once in force) and other international instruments
   
   Non-arbitrable disputes (reserved for tribal court):
   i) Disputes primarily involving interpretation of tribal law or cultural protocols
   ii) Sacred site protections and cultural heritage matters
   iii) Succession and trust administration matters
   iv) Any dispute where tribal court has jurisdiction and is available

d) **SUBSTANTIVE LAW AND PRINCIPLES:**
   The arbitral tribunal shall apply:
   i) The express terms of this license
   ii) Federal Indian law and tribal sovereignty principles
   iii) UNDRIP, American Declaration on Indigenous Peoples' Rights, and international Indigenous rights norms
   iv) WIPO Treaty provisions (contractually incorporated, and as binding treaty once in force)
   v) General principles of international intellectual property law
   vi) Equity and good conscience where law is silent
   
   Indian canons of construction apply: ambiguities construed liberally in favor of Indigenous rights and tribal sovereignty.

e) **INTERIM MEASURES:**
   The arbitral tribunal has authority to:
   i) Order preliminary injunctions protecting Traditional Knowledge and sacred sites
   ii) Order asset freezing pending final award
   iii) Order expedited discovery of evidence at risk of destruction
   iv) Impose sanctions for discovery violations or bad faith conduct

f) **CONFIDENTIALITY:**
   Arbitration proceedings shall be confidential EXCEPT:
   i) As necessary to enforce arbitral awards
   ii) To protect Traditional Knowledge and cultural heritage
   iii) For reporting to tribal authorities and oversight bodies
   iv) Where confidentiality would shield violations of Indigenous rights

g) **COSTS AND FEES:**
   i) **Arbitration Costs**: Initially borne equally by parties
   ii) **Final Allocation**: Tribunal may award costs to prevailing party
   iii) **Rights Holder Protection**: If Rights Holder prevails, respondent pays all arbitration costs, attorney fees, and expert fees
   iv) **Fee Advances**: For indigent Rights Holder, respondent may be required to advance Rights Holder's share of arbitration costs

h) **ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS:**
   Arbitral awards shall be enforceable:
   i) **New York Convention**: In all 172 countries party to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958)
   ii) **US Federal Courts**: Under 9 U.S.C. §§ 201-208 (FAA Chapter 2)
   iii) **Tribal Courts**: Tribal courts shall recognize and enforce arbitral awards
   iv) **Foreign Courts**: Through New York Convention domestication procedures
   
   Awards shall be final and binding with limited grounds for challenge (public policy, due process, excess of jurisdiction).

i) **APPEAL/REVIEW:**
   No appeal on merits except:
   i) Manifest disregard of law or evidence (under applicable law)
   ii) Fraud, corruption, or serious procedural irregularity
   iii) Violation of public policy (arbitrability, due process)
   iv) Excess of arbitral authority
   
   Any challenge must be brought within time limits under New York Convention and applicable national law.

j) **RELATIONSHIP TO TRIBAL COURT:**
   i) Arbitration does NOT waive tribal sovereign immunity
   ii) Arbitration is alternative to, not replacement for, tribal court jurisdiction
   iii) Rights Holder retains absolute discretion to elect tribal court over arbitration
   iv) Tribal court decisions on cultural matters binding on arbitral tribunal

k) **INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT:**
   Parties may request administration by:
   i) Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) - has experience with indigenous matters
   ii) International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) - if applicable
   iii) International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration
   iv) Administered arbitration ensures procedural integrity and institutional support
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Provides complete arbitration clause meeting New York Convention Article II
- Specifies all essential procedural elements
- Ensures Indigenous expertise on tribunal
- Preserves tribal sovereignty and cultural protections
- Creates enforceable awards in 172 countries
- Addresses cost concerns for Rights Holder

---

### Amendment 3: Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Procedures (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Insert After Section 12.3A (Cross-Border Enforcement), Replace Lines 98-104 With:**

```markdown
**12.3A MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY (MLAT) INVOCATION PROCEDURES**

Where license violations involve criminal conduct (fraud, theft, misappropriation, false origin claims under IACA), the Rights Holder may seek assistance through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties by following these procedures:

a) **CRIMINAL VIOLATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   License violations that may constitute crimes include:
   i) **IACA Violations**: Falsely suggesting Indian origin (25 U.S.C. § 305e) - up to 15 years imprisonment
   ii) **Fraud**: Wire fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1343), mail fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1341) in connection with license violations
   iii) **Computer Fraud**: Unauthorized access to systems containing the Work (18 U.S.C. § 1030)
   iv) **Theft of Trade Secrets**: Economic Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. § 1831-1839) if TK qualifies as trade secret
   v) **Criminal Copyright Infringement**: 18 U.S.C. § 2319 for willful infringement for commercial advantage
   vi) **Foreign Equivalents**: Fraud, misappropriation, cultural property offenses under foreign law

b) **MLAT INITIATION PROCESS:**
   i) **Step 1 - Criminal Complaint**: File criminal complaint with appropriate US law enforcement:
       (1) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) - for IACA, fraud, computer crimes
       (2) U.S. Attorney's Office for relevant district
       (3) DOJ Criminal Division, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS)
       (4) DOJ Environmental and Natural Resources Division, Indian Resources Section
   
   ii) **Step 2 - Investigation**: Cooperate with federal investigation, providing:
       (1) Evidence of license violation
       (2) Documentation of criminal conduct elements
       (3) Digital forensics evidence per Section 9A.7
       (4) Expert testimony on cultural harm and TK value
       (5) Financial analysis showing economic harm
   
   iii) **Step 3 - Prosecution Decision**: If US Attorney determines prosecution warranted, criminal case proceeds domestically
   
   iv) **Step 4 - MLAT Request**: If evidence or assets located abroad, prosecutor requests international assistance through:
       (1) DOJ Office of International Affairs (OIA)
       (2) Identifies applicable MLAT with foreign country
       (3) Submits formal MLAT request to foreign central authority
       (4) Foreign government executes request under its domestic law

c) **US BILATERAL MLAT COVERAGE:**
   The United States has MLATs with 70+ countries, including:
   i) **Americas**: Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, etc.
   ii) **Europe**: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, etc.
   iii) **Asia**: Japan, South Korea, India, Hong Kong, Thailand, Philippines, etc.
   iv) **Oceania**: Australia, New Zealand
   
   Full list: https://www.justice.gov/criminal-oia/international-agreements

d) **MLAT ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE:**
   Through MLATs, US can request foreign governments to:
   i) Locate and interview witnesses
   ii) Obtain banking and financial records
   iii) Execute search warrants and seize evidence
   iv) Freeze and forfeit assets
   v) Serve legal process
   vi) Transfer persons in custody for testimony
   vii) Trace proceeds of criminal activity

e) **TIMELINE AND LIMITATIONS:**
   i) **Timeline**: MLAT requests typically take 6-18 months
   ii) **Requirements**: Foreign government must find request meets its domestic legal standards
   iii) **Dual Criminality**: Often required - conduct must be crime in both countries
   iv) **Political Offense Exception**: MLATs typically exclude political offenses
   v) **Specialty Principle**: Evidence obtained via MLAT can only be used for stated purpose

f) **ALTERNATIVES TO MLAT:**
   Where MLAT unavailable or too slow:
   i) **Letters Rogatory**: Request through diplomatic channels (slower than MLAT)
   ii) **Hague Evidence Convention**: For service of process and evidence gathering in 64+ countries
   iii) **Private Investigation**: Hire international investigators (limited powers)
   iv) **Interpol**: For locating fugitives and international coordination
   v) **Direct Foreign Court Proceedings**: File civil/criminal cases in foreign courts

g) **TRIBAL GOVERNMENT COORDINATION:**
   i) Rights Holder should coordinate MLAT efforts with Grand Traverse Band government
   ii) Tribal government may communicate government-to-government with US federal agencies
   iii) Tribal sovereignty strengthens federal government interest in prosecution
   iv) Tribal cultural harm expert testimony critical for prosecution

h) **NON-CRIMINAL MLAT ALTERNATIVES:**
   For civil disputes not rising to criminal level:

### Amendment 5: Regional Instruments Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Insert After UNDRIP References (Line 442), Add:**

```markdown
**INTEGRATION OF REGIONAL INDIGENOUS RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS**

In addition to UNDRIP, this license invokes and incorporates the following regional instruments that provide binding or politically binding protections for Indigenous intellectual property:

a) **AMERICAN DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (2016):**
   
   Adopted by the Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly on June 15, 2016 (AG/RES. 2888 (XLVI-O/16)), including the United States as an OAS member state.
   
   **Relevant Articles:**
   i) **Article XIII (Collective Intellectual Property Rights)**: Indigenous peoples have collective rights to protect and develop their traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, sciences, technologies, and intellectual property. States shall establish mechanisms for recognition and protection of these rights.
   
   ii) **Article XIV (Cultural Identity and Diversity)**: Indigenous peoples have the right to develop and maintain their cultural identity and distinctiveness, including the right to the recognition and respect of their laws, traditions, customs, and institutions.
   
   iii) **Article XXI (Autonomy and Self-Government)**: Indigenous peoples have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, including intellectual property, culture, and natural resources.
   
   iv) **Article XXIX (Treaties and Agreements)**: Indigenous peoples have the right to the recognition, observance and enforcement of treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements concluded with States or their successors, according to their spirit and intent, and for States to honor and respect such treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements.
   
   **Enforcement**: While the American Declaration's binding force is debated, OAS member states (including the US) have adopted it, creating political commitments enforceable through Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.

b) **ILO CONVENTION NO. 169 (INDIGENOUS AND TRIBAL PEOPLES CONVENTION, 1989):**
   
   **Status**: International Labour Organization treaty adopted June 27, 1989; entered into force September 5, 1991; 24 ratifications as of 2025.
   
   **US Status**: NOT ratified by United States. However, ILO 169 represents international consensus on indigenous rights and may be cited as evidence of customary international law.
   
   **Relevant Provisions**:
   i) **Article 2**: Governments have responsibility for developing coordinated and systematic action to protect indigenous rights.
   ii) **Article 13**: Governments shall respect special importance of relationship of indigenous peoples to their lands and the collective aspects of this relationship.
   iii) **Article 15**: Indigenous peoples have rights to natural resources pertaining to their lands, including participation in use, management, and conservation, and consultation regarding exploitation.
   iv) **Article 23**: Handicrafts, rural and community-based industries, and subsistence economy and traditional activities (including TK) shall be recognized and supported.
   
   **Application to License**: May invoke ILO 169 principles in countries that have ratified (primarily Latin America) as binding treaty obligations.

c) **NAGOYA PROTOCOL ON ACCESS AND BENEFIT-SHARING (2010):**
   
   **Full Name**: Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity
   
   **Status**: Adopted October 29, 2010; entered into force October 12, 2014; 138 parties as of 2025.
   
   **US Status**: NOT a party (US has not ratified Convention on Biological Diversity).
   
   **Relevant Provisions**:
   i) **Article 5**: Fair and equitable benefit-sharing from utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge
   ii) **Article 7**: Traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources must be accessed with prior informed consent
   iii) **Article 12**: Contracting Parties shall establish benefit-sharing arrangements for traditional knowledge
   iv) **Article 16**: Compliance mechanisms for users of genetic resources and traditional knowledge
   
   **Application to License**: 
   - This license's 20-30% benefit-sharing requirement aligns with Nagoya Protocol principles
   - May invoke Nagoya obligations in the 138 party countries
   - Demonstrates international consensus on TK benefit-sharing norms

d) **CROSS-REFERENCING AND INTEGRATION:**
   
   i) **Interpretive Principle**: All provisions of this license shall be interpreted consistently with the above regional and international instruments where such interpretation strengthens Indigenous rights protections.
   
   ii) **Conflict Resolution**: Where any provision of this license conflicts with the above instruments, the interpretation most favorable to Indigenous rights and tribal sovereignty shall prevail under the Indian canons of construction.
   
   iii) **Evidence of International Norms**: These instruments may be cited in any proceedings under this license as evidence of:
       (1) International consensus on Indigenous intellectual property rights
       (2) Customary international law principles
       (3) Good faith obligations of states and non-state actors
       (4) Appropriate remedies and benefit-sharing percentages
   
   iv) **Advocacy Framework**: These instruments provide framework for diplomatic escalation under Section 12.3B.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Adds binding regional treaty (American Declaration via OAS)
- Incorporates ILO 169 where it may be binding
- Links to Nagoya Protocol benefit-sharing framework
- Provides alternative legal bases beyond non-binding UNDRIP
- Creates basis for regional enforcement (IACHR)

## VI. Conclusion

The license's **international enforcement provisions are currently aspirational rather than operational**. The recommended amendments:

1. **Create enforceable international arbitration** - Valid UNCITRAL clause
2. **Provide realistic MLAT procedures** - Acknowledge government-to-government nature
3. **Establish diplomatic escalation pathways** - Clear procedures with realistic expectations
4. **Integrate binding regional instruments** - Beyond non-binding UNDRIP
5. **Prepare for WIPO Treaty** - Automatic incorporation upon entry into force

**Risk Reduction:** Implementing these amendments reduces international enforcement vulnerabilities from **HIGH** to **MEDIUM**, creating practical pathways for cross-border enforcement while setting realistic expectations about timelines and diplomatic discretion.

**Critical Success Factor:** International enforcement requires sustained effort over years, coalition building with other Indigenous peoples, and coordination with sympathetic governments. These amendments provide the legal framework for such efforts.
