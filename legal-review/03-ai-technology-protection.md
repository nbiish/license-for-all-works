**Document:** 03-ai-technology-protection.md  
**Priority Level:** HIGH  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## I. Current License Provisions - AI & Technology Framework

### A. AI Training Prohibition (Section 7.1-7.5, Lines 23-43)

**Current Language:**
> "Based on the precedent established in Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GmbH v. Ross Intelligence Inc. (February 2025, appeal pending in Third Circuit as of July 2025 with arguments heard and decision imminent), which held that training AI systems on copyrighted material without permission is NOT fair use..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Cites Thomson Reuters precedent
- ✓ Comprehensive AI prohibition language
- ✓ Covers multiple AI types (LLM, neural networks, etc.)
- ⚠ Relies ENTIRELY on unsettled precedent on appeal
- ⚠ No independent legal basis beyond copyright fair use
- ⚠ Missing technical detection specifications
- ⚠ No Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) integration
- ⚠ Liquidated damages ($500,000, Line 25) lack supporting calculation

### B. Digital Forensics (Section 9A.7, Lines 719-765)

**Current Language:**
> "The financial institution selected pursuant to Section 9A.2 shall establish and maintain comprehensive digital forensics capabilities..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Mandates forensic watermarking
- ✓ Requires automated monitoring
- ✓ Chain of custody requirements
- ✓ Expert qualifications specified
- ⚠ Technical specifications too general
- ⚠ Watermarking standards not specified (which standard?)
- ⚠ No specific detection thresholds
- ⚠ Budget cap (5-8%) may be insufficient for sophisticated AI detection
- ⚠ Missing AI-specific detection methodologies

### C. Emerging Technology Restrictions (Section 7.5, Lines 35-43)

**Current Language:**
> "To future-proof this license against technological developments that may threaten tribal sovereignty and Indigenous rights, the following emerging technologies are subject to the same restrictions..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Comprehensive list (quantum computing, biotech, BCI, etc.)
- ✓ Forward-looking approach
- ⚠ Definitions too vague (e.g., "advanced robotics")
- ⚠ No distinction between beneficial and harmful uses
- ⚠ May be overbroad and unenforceable
- ⚠ Lacks connection to specific harms

## II. Critical AI & Technology Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability 1: Thomson Reuters Precedent Instability

**Issue:** The entire AI training prohibition (Section 7.1-7.4) relies on Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence, which is **on appeal** with decision pending.

**Thomson Reuters Case Background:**

**Trial Court (SDNY, Feb 2025):**
- **Holding**: Training AI on copyrighted legal documents is NOT fair use
- **Rationale**: 
  - Purpose was commercial (creating competing product)
  - Nature was creative (legal analysis and synthesis)
  - Amount was substantial (entire Westlaw database)
  - Market effect was direct competition
- **Key Finding**: AI training is "intermediate copying" that requires authorization

**Appeal Status (July 2025 per license):**
- Appealed to Third Circuit Court of Appeals
- Arguments heard
- Decision imminent (could come any time)

**Why This Matters:**

**Scenario 1: Third Circuit Affirms**
- AI training prohibition strengthened
- Multiple circuits may follow
- Could reach Supreme Court
- Timeline: 1-3 years for final resolution

**Scenario 2: Third Circuit Reverses**
- District court holding overturned
- AI training may be fair use
- License's primary AI protection collapses
- Need alternative legal theories immediately

**Scenario 3: Third Circuit Narrow Holding**
- Affirms on specific facts (legal documents)
- Unclear application to Traditional Knowledge
- Ambiguity invites challenges

**Current Risk:**
License treats Thomson Reuters as settled law. If reversed, AI companies will immediately challenge AI training prohibitions as contrary to binding precedent.

**Related Pending AI Copyright Cases:**
- *Andersen v. Stability AI* (N.D. Cal.) - AI art generation
- *Getty Images v. Stability AI* (D. Del.) - image training datasets
- *Doe v. GitHub* (N.D. Cal.) - Copilot code training
- *Authors Guild v. OpenAI* (S.D.N.Y.) - book training datasets

**None have reached appellate resolution** - entire area of law unsettled.

---

### Vulnerability 2: No Independent Legal Basis Beyond Copyright

**Issue:** AI training prohibition relies entirely on copyright fair use analysis. If copyright fair use permits AI training, license has no fallback position.

**Alternative Legal Theories NOT Invoked:**

#### A. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) - 18 U.S.C. § 1030

**Applicability:**
If AI companies access systems containing the Work without authorization or exceeding authorization, they violate CFAA.

**CFAA Elements:**
1. Intentionally accesses a computer
2. Without authorization or exceeding authorized access
3. Thereby obtains information

**CFAA Penalties:**
- Civil: Actual damages, injunctive relief
- Criminal: Fines, imprisonment up to 10 years

**Application to AI Training:**
- License specifies authorized uses (Section 8)
- AI training is prohibited use (Section 7.1)
- Accessing Work for AI training = exceeding authorization
- Scraping/downloading for training = unauthorized access

**Current License:** Does NOT cite CFAA

**Why This Matters:**
CFAA provides **independent basis** not dependent on fair use analysis. Even if Thomson Reuters reversed, CFAA claims survive.

**Recent Precedent:**
- *hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn* (9th Cir. 2022) - Computer fraud for scraping
- *Van Buren v. United States* (2021) - CFAA scope clarified

---

#### B. Breach of Contract

**Applicability:**
License is contract. AI training violates contract terms.

**Advantage:**
Contract claims NOT subject to Copyright Act preemption if they contain "extra element" beyond copyright.

**Extra Elements:**
- Promise not to use for AI training
- Compliance with TK protocols
- Prior Informed Consent requirement
- Benefit-sharing obligations

**Current License:** Implicit contract but lacks explicit formation language

---

#### C. Trade Secret Misappropriation - 18 U.S.C. § 1836 (DTSA)

**Applicability:**
If Traditional Knowledge qualifies as trade secret:
- Economic value from secrecy
- Subject to reasonable secrecy measures
- Not generally known

**DTSA Remedies:**
- Injunctive relief
- Actual damages
- Exemplary damages up to 2x
- Attorney fees for willful violations

**Application to TK:**
Traditional Knowledge with restricted access/confidentiality could qualify as trade secret.

**Current License:** Does NOT cite trade secret protection

---

#### D. Misappropriation (State Common Law)

**Applicability:**
Hot news misappropriation doctrine (surviving NBA v. Motorola):
- Plaintiff generates information at cost
- Defendant free-rides on plaintiff's efforts
- Time-sensitive competitive value

**Application to AI:**
AI companies free-ride on TK/TCE curation and documentation.

**Current License:** Does NOT cite misappropriation

---

#### E. Breach of Confidence (Equitable Doctrine)

**Applicability:**
Information disclosed in confidence cannot be used without authorization.

**Application to AI:**
TK shared subject to confidentiality and cultural protocols creates duty of confidence.

**Current License:** Implicit in TK Labels but not explicitly invoked

---

### Vulnerability 3: Technical Detection Specifications Insufficient

**Issue:** Section 9A.7 mandates "forensic watermarking" but lacks technical specifications for AI-era detection.

**Current Watermarking Limitations:**

**Traditional Watermarking:**
- Designed for human-detectable alterations
- Vulnerable to AI pre-processing
- Not optimized for dataset ingestion

**AI Training Challenges:**
- Large-scale preprocessing removes traditional watermarks
- Normalization, tokenization destroys signals
- Model outputs don't contain original watermarked content
- Detection requires different approach

**What's Missing:**

#### A. Adversarial Watermarking Standards

**Concept:** Watermarks designed to survive AI preprocessing

**Techniques:**
- Frequency domain watermarks (survive normalization)
- Statistical watermarks (detectable in outputs)
- Provenance markers (trace through training)

**Standards:**
- No industry standard yet adopted
- Research-stage technologies (2024-2025)
- License doesn't specify research requirements

---

#### B. Dataset Poisoning Detection

**Concept:** Deliberate markers that affect model behavior if Work included in training

**Techniques:**
- Adversarial examples
- Backdoor triggers
- Statistical fingerprints in model weights

**Application:**
If Work included in training, model exhibits detectable behaviors.

**Current License:** Does NOT mention dataset poisoning or behavioral fingerprinting

---

#### C. Model Interrogation Techniques

**Concept:** Query AI model to detect if trained on specific content

**Techniques:**
- Membership inference attacks
- Extraction attacks
- Statistical correlation testing

**Application:**
Can test if GPT/Claude/etc. was trained on protected TK.

**Current License:** Does NOT specify model interrogation rights or procedures

---

### Vulnerability 4: Damages for AI Violations Unclear

**Issue:** License specifies $500,000 minimum liquidated damages for AI violations (Line 25) but:

**Problems:**
1. **No Supporting Calculation:** Why $500,000? Based on what?
2. **No Graduated Scale:** Same penalty for startup vs. OpenAI?
3. **No Revenue Multiple:** AI companies generate billions from training
4. **May Be Penalty:** Courts reduce liquidated damages without nexus to actual harm

**Actual Damages Hard to Calculate:**
- How much value does one work add to training dataset?
- How to quantify cultural harm from AI appropriation?
- What's market value of Traditional Knowledge in AI?

**Statutory Damages Unavailable:**
- Copyright Act statutory damages: $750-$150,000 per work (17 U.S.C. § 504)
- Only available for registered copyrights
- May not cover TK/TCE not meeting copyright standards

---

### Vulnerability 5: Quantum Computing & Emerging Tech Overbreadth

**Issue:** Section 7.5 prohibits "quantum computing applications" and other emerging technologies without distinction between harmful and beneficial uses.

**Potential Problems:**

**Quantum Computing (7.5.a):**
- Prohibition: "quantum machine learning, quantum simulation, quantum cryptographic applications"
- Problem: Quantum cryptography could PROTECT Traditional Knowledge
- Quantum simulation could model traditional medicines
- Blanket prohibition prevents beneficial research

**Biotechnology (7.5.b):**
- Prohibition: "genetic research, synthetic biology, bioinformatics"
- Problem: Indigenous communities may WANT genetic research on traditional medicines
- Synthetic biology could preserve endangered traditional plants
- Prevents community-controlled research

**Brain-Computer Interfaces (7.5.c):**
- Prohibition: "neural implants, brain-computer interfaces"
- Problem: Could preserve traditional stories for language revitalization
- Could help disabled community members access cultural knowledge
- Too broad

**Risk:**
Courts may find prohibitions overbroad and unenforceable restraints on technology development.

**Better Approach:**
Distinguish unauthorized commercial exploitation from authorized community-beneficial research.

---

## III. AI Legal Landscape Analysis

### A. Current AI Copyright Litigation (as of Jan 2025)

#### 1. Thomson Reuters v. Ross Intelligence (SDNY, on appeal)

**Status:** District court ruled for Thomson Reuters; Third Circuit appeal pending

**Key Holdings:**
- AI training on copyrighted material requires authorization
- Fair use does NOT apply when creating competing product
- "Intermediate copying" for training is infringing use

**Weaknesses:**
- District court only (not binding precedent yet)
- On appeal with uncertain outcome
- May be limited to specific facts (legal research)

---

#### 2. Andersen v. Stability AI (N.D. Cal.)

**Plaintiffs:** Visual artists  
**Defendant:** Stability AI (Stable Diffusion)  
**Claims:** Copyright infringement, DMCA violations, right of publicity

**Status:** Motion to dismiss partially granted (Sept 2023), discovery ongoing

**Key Issues:**
- Are AI-generated outputs "derivative works"?
- Is training on copyrighted images fair use?
- Do AI companies violate DMCA by removing copyright management info?

**Outcome:** Undecided; could take 2-3 years

---

#### 3. Getty Images v. Stability AI (D. Del.)

**Plaintiff:** Getty Images (stock photo company)  
**Defendant:** Stability AI  
**Claims:** Copyright infringement (billions of images), trademark (watermark reproduction)

**Status:** Active litigation; motion to dismiss denied (Oct 2023)

**Key Issues:**
- Mass infringement via AI training
- Removal of watermarks as DMCA violation
- Commercial harm to licensing market

**Notable:** Getty has parallel case in UK High Court

---

#### 4. Authors Guild v. OpenAI (S.D.N.Y.)

**Plaintiffs:** Authors (including George R.R. Martin, John Grisham)  
**Defendant:** OpenAI (ChatGPT)  
**Claims:** Copyright infringement via training on books without authorization

**Status:** Consolidated class action; motion to dismiss partially granted (Feb 2024)

**Key Issues:**
- Fair use for large language model training
- Whether outputs constitute copyright infringement
- Market harm to book authors

---

### B. Fair Use Factors Applied to AI Training

**17 U.S.C. § 107 - Fair Use Factors:**

#### Factor 1: Purpose and Character of Use

**Transformative Use Analysis:**
- AI training arguably "transformative" (creates new capability)
- But commercial purpose weighs against fair use
- Creating competing product (per Thomson Reuters) = not fair use

**Application to License:**
- Commercial AI training clearly commercial
- Not transformative if appropriating TK for profit
- Cultural appropriation is NOT transformative

---

#### Factor 2: Nature of Copyrighted Work

**Creative vs. Factual:**
- Creative works get stronger protection
- Traditional Cultural Expressions are creative
- Traditional Knowledge may be factual but confidential

**Application to License:**
- TK/TCEs are creative expressions
- Confidential/sacred nature strengthens protection
- Factor weighs against fair use

---

#### Factor 3: Amount and Substantiality Used

**Wholesale Copying:**
- AI training often uses entire works
- Wholesale copying disfavors fair use

**Application to License:**
- If Work used in training, likely entire Work used
- Factor weighs against fair use

---

#### Factor 4: Market Effect

**Commercial Harm:**
- AI creates competing products
- Reduces market for original work
- Deprives creator of licensing fees

**Application to License:**
- AI trained on TK competes with Rights Holder's knowledge
- Reduces ability to license TK
- Prevents benefit-sharing (20% commercial revenue)
- Factor weighs strongly against fair use

---

### C. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for AI

**18 U.S.C. § 1030 - CFAA Elements:**

#### § 1030(a)(2)(C) - Unauthorized Access

**Prohibition:**
> "Intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains information from any protected computer"

**Application to AI Scraping:**
1. **"Protected computer":** Any computer connected to internet (broadly defined)
2. **"Without authorization":** Accessing beyond permission granted
3. **"Obtains information":** Downloading/copying content

**Key Case: hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn (9th Cir. 2022)**

**Facts:** hiQ scraped public LinkedIn profiles; LinkedIn sent cease and desist

**Holding:** Accessing publicly available information without authorization can violate CFAA if access violates terms of use

**Application to License:**
- License specifies authorized uses (Section 8)
- AI training explicitly prohibited (Section 7.1)
- Accessing for prohibited purpose = exceeding authorization
- CFAA violation

---

#### § 1030(a)(4) - Access with Intent to Defraud

**Prohibition:**
> "Knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value"

**Application to AI:**
- Accessing Work by misrepresenting purpose (e.g., claiming research when commercial)
- Obtaining TK of value
- Furthering fraudulent scheme (commercial AI without paying)

---

#### CFAA Remedies

**Civil (§ 1030(g)):**
- Compensatory damages
- Injunctive relief
- Costs and reasonable attorney fees

**Criminal (§ 1030(c)):**
- First offense: Fine, up to 1 year imprisonment
- Subsequent offense: Fine, up to 10 years imprisonment
- If offense committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain: Fine, up to 5 years (first), 10 years (subsequent)

---

### D. Trade Secret Protection for Traditional Knowledge

**Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) - 18 U.S.C. § 1836**

**Trade Secret Definition (§ 1839):**
Information that:
1. Derives independent economic value from not being generally known
2. Is the subject of reasonable secrecy measures

**Application to Traditional Knowledge:**

**Qualifies as Trade Secret IF:**
- ✓ TK not publicly available (restricted access per TK Labels)
- ✓ Has economic value (licensing potential, commercial applications)
- ✓ Secrecy measures taken (PIC requirements, access controls, confidentiality)

**Does NOT Qualify IF:**
- ✗ TK published without restrictions
- ✗ No secrecy measures
- ✗ Widely known information

**DTSA Remedies:**
- Injunctive relief (preventing further use)
- Actual damages
- Unjust enrichment damages
- Exemplary damages up to 2x for willful violations
- Attorney fees for bad faith

**Advantage Over Copyright:**
- No registration required
- Potentially perpetual protection (as long as secret maintained)
- Not subject to Copyright Act preemption (uses different elements)

**Strategic Application:**
Characterize restricted Traditional Knowledge as trade secret in addition to TK/TCE.

## IV. Recommended AI & Technology Protection Amendments

### Amendment 1: Multi-Theory Legal Basis for AI Prohibition (CRITICAL)

**Insert After Section 7.1-7.4 (AI Training Prohibition), Add New Section 7.1A:**

```markdown
**7.1A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL BASIS FOR AI TRAINING PROHIBITION**

The prohibition on using the Work for AI training, development, or enhancement (Section 7.1) is grounded in multiple independent legal theories, each providing separate and cumulative basis for enforcement:

a) **COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT:**
   i) Training AI systems on copyrighted material without authorization constitutes copyright infringement through unauthorized reproduction and creation of derivative works (17 U.S.C. § 106);
   
   ii) AI training is NOT fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 when analyzed under the four-factor test:
       (1) **Purpose**: Commercial AI training to create competing products is commercial, not transformative (*Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GmbH v. Ross Intelligence Inc.*, S.D.N.Y. 2025);
       (2) **Nature**: Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions are creative works entitled to strong copyright protection;
       (3) **Amount**: AI training typically uses entire works, constituting wholesale copying;
       (4) **Market Effect**: AI trained on the Work competes with the Rights Holder, reduces licensing opportunities, and prevents benefit-sharing required by this license;
   
   iii) Even if *Thomson Reuters* is reversed on appeal, the specific application to Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions remains distinguishable based on cultural sensitivity, community rights, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles not present in commercial database cases;

b) **COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT (CFAA) - 18 U.S.C. § 1030:**
   i) **Unauthorized Access Violation (§ 1030(a)(2)(C))**:
       (1) This license specifies authorized uses (Section 8) and prohibited uses (Section 7);
       (2) AI training is explicitly prohibited;
       (3) Accessing the Work for AI training purposes constitutes "exceeding authorized access" under CFAA;
       (4) "Obtains information" element satisfied by downloading/copying Work for training datasets;
   
   ii) **Access with Intent to Defraud (§ 1030(a)(4))**:
       (1) Accessing Work by misrepresenting intended use (e.g., claiming educational/research purpose while actually commercial AI development);
       (2) Obtaining Traditional Knowledge of value through such misrepresentation;
       (3) Furthering commercial AI scheme without required compensation;
   
   iii) **Remedies Available**:
       (1) Civil: Compensatory damages, injunctive relief, attorney fees (§ 1030(g));
       (2) Criminal: Fines and imprisonment up to 10 years for repeat offenses or commercial advantage violations (§ 1030(c));
   
   iv) This CFAA basis is **independent of copyright** and survives regardless of fair use determinations;

c) **BREACH OF CONTRACT:**
   i) This license constitutes a binding contract between the Rights Holder and any user of the Work;
   ii) By accessing or using the Work, users accept the terms of this license including AI training prohibition;
   iii) AI training violates explicit contractual prohibition;
   iv) Contract claims contain "extra element" (promise not to train AI) beyond copyright infringement, avoiding Copyright Act preemption (17 U.S.C. § 301);
   v) Remedies include contract damages, disgorgement of profits, and specific performance (injunction);

d) **TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION - 18 U.S.C. § 1836 (DTSA):**
   i) **Trade Secret Qualification**: Traditional Knowledge that is:
       (1) Subject to reasonable secrecy measures (PIC requirements, access controls, TK Labels, confidentiality protocols);
       (2) Derives independent economic value from not being generally known;
       (3) Restricted to authorized users under this license;
       
       qualifies as "trade secret" under 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3);
   
   ii) **Misappropriation Occurs When**:
       (1) AI companies acquire TK by improper means (violating access restrictions);
       (2) Disclose or use TK without consent, knowing or having reason to know it was acquired through improper means;
       (3) Use TK in AI training violates confidentiality obligations;
   
   iii) **DTSA Remedies**:
       (1) Injunctive relief preventing further AI training or use (§ 1836(b)(3)(A));
       (2) Actual damages for economic harm;
       (3) Unjust enrichment damages (AI company profits from misappropriated TK);
       (4) Exemplary damages up to 2x actual damages for willful violations (§ 1836(b)(3)(D));
       (5) Attorney fees for bad faith (§ 1836(b)(3)(D));
   
   iv) Trade secret protection is **perpetual** (unlike copyright's limited term) and **independent** of fair use analysis;

e) **BREACH OF CONFIDENCE (EQUITABLE DOCTRINE):**
   i) Traditional Knowledge shared subject to confidentiality obligations and cultural protocols creates equitable duty of confidence;
   ii) Using TK for unauthorized AI training breaches duty of confidence;
   iii) Remedies include injunction, disgorgement of profits (accounting), and constructive trust;
   iv) Particularly applicable where TK has sacred, ceremonial, or culturally sensitive nature;

f) **MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTANGIBLE PROPERTY:**
   i) Traditional Knowledge constitutes intangible property right recognized under tribal law and federal Indian law;
   ii) Unauthorized commercial exploitation constitutes common law misappropriation (*International News Service v. Associated Press*, 248 U.S. 215 (1918) framework);
   iii) AI companies free-ride on Rights Holder's investment in documenting and curating Traditional Knowledge;
   iv) Remedies include injunction and restitution of unjust enrichment;

g) **TRIBAL LAW VIOLATIONS:**
   i) Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians tribal law governs intellectual property created by tribal members;
   ii) Tribal cultural property laws prohibit unauthorized commercial exploitation of Traditional Knowledge;
   iii) Violations subject to tribal court jurisdiction under *Montana v. United States* exceptions;
   iv) Tribal law remedies cumulative with federal remedies;

h) **INTERNATIONAL LAW VIOLATIONS:**
   i) WIPO Treaty on Traditional Knowledge (once in force) requires disclosure of TK sources in patents;
   ii) Using Work in AI training without disclosure and benefit-sharing violates treaty obligations (contractually incorporated per Section 9-21);
   iii) UNDRIP Article 31 recognizes Indigenous peoples' rights to control Traditional Knowledge and Cultural Expressions;
   iv) Users violating AI training prohibition breach international norms regardless of domestic copyright determinations;

i) **CUMULATIVE AND INDEPENDENT THEORIES:**
   i) Each legal theory above provides **independent and sufficient basis** for enforcing AI training prohibition;
   ii) Rights Holder may pursue remedies under **any or all theories** simultaneously or sequentially;
   iii) If any single theory fails (e.g., fair use found in copyright), other theories remain fully enforceable;
   iv) This multi-theory approach ensures enforceability regardless of developments in any single area of law;

j) **BURDEN ON CHALLENGER:**
   Any party challenging the AI training prohibition must demonstrate that **ALL** legal theories above fail, not merely that one theory (e.g., copyright fair use) might permit AI training. This high burden reflects the comprehensive protections necessary for Indigenous intellectual property and Traditional Knowledge.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Creates multiple independent fallback positions
- Survives reversal of Thomson Reuters
- CFAA and trade secret theories don't depend on copyright
- Contract and breach of confidence provide equitable remedies
- Tribal law and international law add additional layers
- Forces challengers to defeat all theories, not just one

### Amendment 3: Graduated AI Violation Damages (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Replace Line 25 ($500,000 minimum liquidated damages) With:**

```markdown
**7.6 GRADUATED DAMAGES FOR AI TRAINING VIOLATIONS**

Violations of the AI training prohibition (Sections 7.1-7.5) shall result in damages calculated according to the following graduated scale, reflecting the violator's resources, extent of violation, and cultural harm:

a) **BASE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (Violation Detection):**
   Upon confirmed detection of AI training on the Work:
   
   i) **Individual Violators**: Minimum $50,000
   ii) **Startup/Small Companies** (< $10M annual revenue): Minimum $100,000
   iii) **Medium Companies** ($10M-$1B annual revenue): Minimum $500,000
   iv) **Large Companies** (> $1B annual revenue): Minimum $2,000,000
   v) **AI-Specialized Companies**: Add 50% multiplier to above amounts

b) **REVENUE-BASED GRADUATED SCALE:**
   In addition to base liquidated damages, violators shall pay percentage of revenue attributable to AI systems:
   
   i) **Revenue Attribution Calculation**:
       (1) Determine total revenue from AI products/services incorporating trained model;
       (2) Calculate proportion of training dataset consisting of protected Work;
       (3) Apply proportion to revenue to determine attributable amount;
   
   ii) **Graduated Percentage**:
       (1) First $10 million attributable revenue: **30%** to Legacy Beneficiary
       (2) Next $90 million (to $100M total): **35%** to Legacy Beneficiary
       (3) Next $400 million (to $500M total): **40%** to Legacy Beneficiary
       (4) All attributable revenue above $500 million: **45%** to Legacy Beneficiary
   
   iii) **Minimum Revenue Assessment**:
       If precise revenue attribution impossible, presume Work constitutes at minimum:
       - 0.01% of training dataset for general models (GPT, Claude, etc.)
       - 1% of training dataset for specialized models (cultural content, Indigenous knowledge)
       - 10% of training dataset for models specifically targeting Traditional Knowledge

c) **CULTURAL HARM MULTIPLIERS:**
   Additional damages for violations involving culturally sensitive content:
   
   i) **Sacred Knowledge/Ceremonial Content**: 3x base damages
   ii) **Restricted Access TK (requiring specific PIC)**: 2x base damages
   iii) **Community Cultural Expressions**: 2x base damages
   iv) **Language Revitalization Materials**: 2x base damages
   
   Multiple multipliers stack (e.g., sacred + restricted = 6x base damages).

d) **WILLFULNESS ENHANCEMENT:**
   For willful violations (violator knew or should have known of prohibition):
   
   i) Double all calculated damages (liquidated + revenue-based + cultural harm)
   ii) Add punitive damages up to 3x total calculated damages
   iii) Mandatory attorney fees and costs reimbursement

e) **CONTINUING VIOLATION PENALTIES:**
   For each day AI training or use continues after notice of violation:
   
   i) $10,000/day for first 30 days
   ii) $25,000/day for days 31-90
   iii) $50,000/day for days 91+
   
   Plus injunctive relief and contempt sanctions.

f) **MODEL DESTRUCTION AND DISGORGEMENT:**
   In addition to monetary damages:
   
   i) **Model Destruction**: Court-supervised destruction of AI models trained on Work
   ii) **Weight Adjustment**: Removal of Work-derived weights if technically feasible
   iii) **Dataset Removal**: Permanent removal of Work from all training datasets
   iv) **Verification**: Independent technical expert verification of compliance
   v) **Ongoing Monitoring**: Rights Holder may test models quarterly for 3 years

g) **ALTERNATIVE LICENSING OPTION:**
   Violator may avoid damages by:
   
   i) Immediate cessation of unauthorized training/use
   ii) Negotiation of retroactive licensing agreement
   iii) Payment of:
       (1) Fair market value for authorized AI training rights (minimum 50% of calculated damages above)
       (2) Ongoing benefit-sharing per Section 6A (30% of future revenue)
       (3) Attorney fees and investigation costs incurred
   iv) Compliance with all PIC requirements going forward
   v) Cultural competency training for relevant personnel

h) **EVIDENCE AND BURDEN OF PROOF:**
   
   i) **Prima Facie Case**: Rights Holder establishes prima facie AI training violation by showing:
       (1) Detection via methods in Section 9A.7 (watermark, membership inference, extraction)
       (2) AI model outputs consistent with training on Work
       (3) Violator had access to Work (directly or via datasets)
   
   ii) **Burden Shifts**: Upon prima facie showing, burden shifts to violator to prove by clear and convincing evidence:
       (1) Work was NOT in training dataset, OR
       (2) Use falls within authorized exceptions (none exist for AI training)
   
   iii) **Discovery**: Violator must provide:
       (1) Complete training dataset documentation
       (2) Model architecture and weights (under protective order)
       (3) Training logs and provenance records
       (4) Revenue and financial data for attribution calculation
   
   Refusal to provide discovery creates rebuttable presumption of violation.

i) **CUMULATIVE WITH OTHER REMEDIES:**
   These AI-specific damages are cumulative with:
   i) Breach of contract damages
   ii) CFAA remedies (§ 1030)
   iii) Trade secret misappropriation damages (DTSA § 1836)
   iv) Copyright infringement damages (if applicable)
   v) Any other applicable legal theories per Section 7.1A
   
   Total recovery shall be greatest of calculated damages under applicable theories, not additive, except for punitive damages which are additive.

j) **PAYMENT ALLOCATION:**
   All damages payments shall be allocated per Section 9A.8 (lifetime) or Section 10.3 (posthumously) to Legacy Beneficiary, with proceeds used first for Beaver Island Band establishment (Section 10.3.d(i)) and descendant support (Section 10.3.d(ii)).
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Graduated scale addresses "penalty" concern by tying to actual harm and violator resources
- Revenue-based calculation provides direct nexus to actual damages
- Cultural harm multipliers quantify non-economic harm
- Provides supporting calculation for liquidated damages
- Burden-shifting addresses evidence asymmetry
- Alternative licensing provides off-ramp reducing litigation
- Cumulative remedies preserve all legal theories

## VI. Conclusion

The license's **AI and technology protections rely too heavily on unsettled copyright precedent**. The recommended amendments:

1. **Create multiple independent legal bases** - CFAA, trade secret, contract, breach of confidence
2. **Add AI-specific detection methodologies** - Membership inference, model interrogation, dataset poisoning
3. **Provide defensible graduated damages** - Revenue-based with supporting calculations
4. **Distinguish beneficial from harmful uses** - Permits community-controlled research while protecting against exploitation

**Risk Reduction:** Implementing these amendments reduces AI protection vulnerabilities from **HIGH** to **LOW-MEDIUM**, ensuring enforceability regardless of Thomson Reuters appeal outcome or fair use developments.

**Critical Success Factor:** Must implement enhanced technical detection (Amendment 2) immediately to document violations. Evidence gathering must begin now to support future enforcement regardless of legal theory used.
