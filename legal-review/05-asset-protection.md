# Asset Protection Provisions Analysis & Amendments

**Document:** 05-asset-protection.md  
**Priority Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## I. Current License Provisions - Asset Protection Framework

### A. Inalienability (Section 6, Lines 529-593)

**Current Language:**
> "The intellectual property rights, Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, cultural heritage, and Indigenous Data embedded within the Work are deemed perpetually inalienable and can never be sold, permanently transferred, assigned, alienated, waived, surrendered, or otherwise permanently divested..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Strong inalienability declaration
- ✓ Prohibits permanent transfers
- ✓ Binds Rights Holder and successors
- ✓ Extends to incarceration scenarios (6.3(g)-(h))
- ⚠ May conflict with bankruptcy law (11 U.S.C.)
- ⚠ Enforcement against secured creditors unclear
- ⚠ Interaction with marital property laws unaddressed

### B. Force Majeure (Section 13.6, Lines 150-156)

**Current Language:**
> "Neither the Rights Holder nor any successor authority shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance of obligations under this license due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to: a) Incarceration and Legal Detainment..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Includes incarceration as force majeure
- ✓ Covers governmental actions and acts of God
- ⚠ Does NOT suspend user obligations (asymmetric)
- ⚠ Unclear what "failure or delay in performance" means for licensor
- ⚠ Missing specific triggers and procedures

### C. Incarceration Protection (Sections 13.7-13.12, Lines 157-242)

**Current Language:**
> "INCARCERATION-SPECIFIC PROTECTION MECHANISMS: During periods of incarceration or detention of the Rights Holder..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Comprehensive incarceration provisions
- ✓ Automatic succession activation
- ✓ Asset protection protocols
- ✓ Personal welfare protections (commissary, education, communication)
- ⚠ May conflict with criminal restitution statutes
- ⚠ BOP regulations may override license terms
- ⚠ State prison systems not bound by federal license terms
- ⚠ Enforcement mechanisms against corrections officials unclear

### D. Living Trust (Section 9A, Lines 672-771)

**Current Language:**
> "During the lifetime of the Rights Holder, all Total Proceeds (as defined in Section 1(i)), compensation, royalties, property, intellectual property rights, and other assets derived from the Work shall be governed by the following provisions..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Mandates financial institution trust establishment
- ✓ Specifies institutional selection criteria
- ✓ Protects asset management during lifetime
- ⚠ Missing specific trust formation timeline
- ⚠ Enforcement if Rights Holder doesn't establish trust
- ⚠ Interaction with existing trusts/estate plans unclear

## II. Critical Asset Protection Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability 1: Bankruptcy Code Conflict

**Issue:** Section 6 (inalienability) may conflict with federal bankruptcy law, which allows certain property transfers.

**Bankruptcy Code Provisions:**

#### 11 U.S.C. § 541 - Property of the Estate

**Rule:**
When debtor files bankruptcy, all "legal or equitable interests" in property become property of the estate, subject to trustee control.

**Exceptions (§ 541(c)(2)):**
> "A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under this title."

**Analysis:**
- **Spendthrift trusts** with transfer restrictions are protected
- **Personal property** owned outright generally NOT protected by inalienability clause
- **Intellectual property rights** are property of estate unless exempt

**Application to License:**

**Problematic Scenario:**
1. Rights Holder files Chapter 7 bankruptcy
2. Bankruptcy trustee takes control of estate assets
3. IP rights in the Work are estate property
4. Trustee could license or sell IP rights to satisfy creditors
5. License's inalienability clause conflicts with § 541

**Courts' Approach:**
- Bankruptcy Code is federal law superseding contractual restrictions (supremacy)
- But tribal sovereign rights may provide exception
- Unclear if inalienability enforceable against bankruptcy trustee

---

#### 11 U.S.C. § 365 - Executory Contracts

**Rule:**
Bankruptcy trustee may **assume or reject** executory contracts (contracts with ongoing obligations).

**Application to License:**
- Is this license an "executory contract"?
- If yes, trustee could reject license, terminating Rights Holder's obligations
- If no, license continues but trustee may control IP rights

**Problem:**
License doesn't address bankruptcy scenario explicitly.

---

### Vulnerability 2: Criminal Restitution vs. Inalienability

**Issue:** Section 6.3(g) prohibits courts from compelling permanent transfer "as part of criminal proceedings" but criminal restitution statutes are mandatory.

**Federal Restitution Statute - 18 U.S.C. § 3663**

**Mandatory Restitution:**
For certain crimes (violence, property crimes), courts MUST order restitution to victims.

**Restitution May Include:**
- Actual losses
- Lost income
- Property damage
- Medical expenses
- Other direct harm

**Problem for Inalienability:**
1. If Rights Holder convicted of crime causing victim financial harm
2. Court must order restitution
3. If Rights Holder has no other assets, court may:
   - Garnish license proceeds
   - Order transfer of IP rights to victim
   - Create lien on IP assets

**License Position (Line 558):**
> "Courts, governmental authorities, correctional institutions, detention facilities, or law enforcement agencies cannot compel or effect: (i) Permanent transfer or sale of rights as part of criminal proceedings..."

**Counter-Argument:**
- Federal sentencing guidelines may require restitution
- Judicial discretion limited by statute
- License cannot override federal criminal law

---

**State Restitution Statutes:**
Most states have similar mandatory restitution for crime victims.

**Example: Michigan Comp. Laws § 780.766:**
- Courts SHALL order restitution
- Covers out-of-pocket losses
- Enforceable as civil judgment

**Problem:**
License claims state courts cannot order restitution from license proceeds, but state criminal law may mandate it.

---

### Vulnerability 3: Automatic Succession Mechanism Ambiguity

**Issue:** Section 13.7(a) states "automatic succession activation" upon incarceration but doesn't specify:

**Critical Gaps:**

1. **WHO determines incarceration status?**
   - Rights Holder's self-declaration?
   - Court order?
   - Incarceration facility notification?
   - Third-party verification?

2. **WHEN does succession activate?**
   - Upon arrest?
   - Upon detention (pre-trial)?
   - Upon conviction?
   - Upon sentencing to prison?
   - After specific duration (e.g., 72 hours)?

3. **HOW do successors learn of activation?**
   - Automatic notification system?
   - Rights Holder must notify?
   - Family member notification?
   - Legal counsel notification?

4. **WHAT if multiple successors designated?**
   - Do all activate simultaneously?
   - Priority order?
   - Majority vote required?

**Current License (Line 158):**
> "Upon confirmed incarceration or arbitrary detention of the Rights Holder, all authorities and responsibilities under this license automatically transfer to the designated successor hierarchy..."

**Problem:**
"Confirmed incarceration" undefined. No procedure for "confirmation."

---

### Vulnerability 4: BOP/DOC Regulations May Override License Terms

**Issue:** Sections 13.10-13.12 prescribe welfare protections during incarceration, but Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and state Departments of Corrections have independent regulatory authority.

**BOP Authority (28 C.F.R. Part 540 et seq.):**

**BOP Controls:**
- Commissary access and limitations
- Communication and correspondence
- Educational programs availability
- Religious practices accommodation
- Discipline and sanctions

**License Cannot Override:**
- Federal regulations have force of law
- BOP has broad discretion over inmates
- Courts defer to BOP on prison management (Turner v. Safley)
- License provisions are aspirational, not enforceable directives to BOP

**Example Conflicts:**

#### A. Commissary Access (Section 13.10(a))

**License (Lines 187-192):**
> "The Rights Holder shall retain unrestricted access to: (i) Personal funds and accounts necessary for commissary purchases..."

**BOP Reality:**
- Commissary spending limits (e.g., $360/month)
- Restrictions on items available
- Discipline can suspend commissary privileges
- No "unrestricted access" in federal prisons

---

#### B. Communication Rights (Section 13.10(c))

**License (Lines 201-206):**
> "Unlimited correspondence with legal counsel regarding license matters..."

**BOP Reality (28 C.F.R. § 540.18):**
- Legal mail monitored for contraband (not read, but inspected)
- Special mail procedures
- General correspondence may be limited
- Video visits replacing in-person visits
- "Unlimited" not guaranteed

---

#### C. Educational Access (Section 13.10(b))

**License (Lines 194-199):**
> "Access to: (i) Educational programs, vocational training, and higher education opportunities..."

**BOP Reality:**
- Limited educational programs based on facility resources
- Waitlists for popular programs
- Budget constraints
- Not all facilities offer higher education
- Distance learning limited

---

### Vulnerability 5: State vs. Federal Incarceration Distinction

**Issue:** License provisions may be more enforceable in federal facilities than state prisons.

**Federal Bureau of Prisons:**
- Single system under DOJ
- Federal regulations apply uniformly
- Federal court oversight via habeas corpus
- Federal Indian law may provide enhanced protections for tribal members

**State Departments of Corrections:**
- 50 different systems with separate regulations
- State law governs (not federal license)
- State courts oversee (may not recognize federal Indian law supremacy)
- Tribal member status less protective in state system

**License Treatment:**
Doesn't distinguish federal vs. state incarceration, treating both identically.

**Practical Difference:**
- Federal BOP may be more amenable to tribal sovereignty arguments
- State DOCs may ignore license provisions entirely
- Enforcement mechanisms different (federal habeas vs. state post-conviction)

---

### Vulnerability 6: Secured Creditors vs. Inalienability

**Issue:** Section 6 prohibits permanent transfers but doesn't address **secured creditors** with liens on IP assets.

**Secured Transactions (UCC Article 9):**

**Secured Party Rights:**
1. Lender can take **security interest** in borrower's assets (including IP)
2. Upon default, secured party can:
   - Foreclose on collateral
   - Sell assets to satisfy debt
   - Take ownership of assets

**IP as Collateral:**
- Patents, copyrights, trademarks can be used as collateral
- UCC Article 9 governs security interests in most personal property
- Federal IP law interacts with UCC (Copyright Act § 205 for copyright)

**Scenario:**
1. Rights Holder borrows money
2. Lender takes security interest in IP rights to Work
3. Rights Holder defaults on loan
4. Lender forecloses, sells IP rights
5. Inalienability clause prohibits permanent transfer
6. Conflict

**UCC § 9-401:**
> "Alienability of Debtor's Rights... A debtor's rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred notwithstanding an agreement between the debtor and secured party which prohibits transfer..."

**Problem:**
UCC may override inalienability clause for secured creditors.

---

### Vulnerability 7: Marital Property and Divorce

**Issue:** Section 6 doesn't address marital property rights or division upon divorce.

**Community Property States (9 states including California, Texas):**
- Property acquired during marriage is community property (50/50 ownership)
- IP created during marriage may be community property
- Upon divorce, courts divide community property

**Equitable Distribution States (most states including Michigan):**
- Courts divide marital property "equitably" (not necessarily 50/50)
- IP created during marriage is marital property subject to division
- Courts have broad discretion

**Scenario:**
1. Rights Holder marries (or is married when creating Work)
2. Spouse may have community property or marital property interest
3. Upon divorce, court divides property
4. Court could award spouse share of IP rights or license proceeds
5. Inalienability clause prohibits such transfer

**Conflict:**
State family courts have authority over marital property division. License cannot override state domestic relations law.

**Michigan Law (MCL 552.19):**
- Courts divide property as "just and reasonable"
- Intellectual property is property subject to division
- Courts often award share of future royalties

---

## III. Case Law on Inalienability and Asset Protection

### A. Bankruptcy and IP Rights

#### In re Peregrine Entertainment, Ltd., 116 B.R. 194 (C.D. Cal. 1990)

**Facts:** Entertainment company filed bankruptcy; owned copyrights used as collateral.

**Holding:** Security interests in copyrights must be recorded in Copyright Office to perfect against bankruptcy trustee.

**Application:** IP rights are property of bankruptcy estate; can be sold/transferred unless exempt.

---

#### In re AbitibiBowater Inc., 418 B.R. 815 (Bankr. D. Del. 2009)

**Facts:** Bankruptcy trustee sought to sell patent rights despite anti-assignment clause.

**Holding:** Bankruptcy Code's policy favoring maximum estate value overrides contractual transfer restrictions.

**Application:** Inalienability clauses may not bind bankruptcy trustee selling IP assets.

---

### B. Criminal Restitution and Assets

#### United States v. Eleven Vehicles, 200 F.3d 203 (3d Cir. 2000)

**Facts:** Criminal forfeiture of property under 21 U.S.C. § 853; defendant claimed property protected.

**Holding:** Criminal forfeiture statute overrides most property protections; "relation back" doctrine gives government ownership from time of criminal act.

**Application:** Criminal asset forfeiture can reach property despite contractual restrictions.

---

#### Honeycutt v. United States, 581 U.S. ___ (2017)

**Facts:** Criminal forfeiture of co-defendant's property to satisfy restitution.

**Holding:** Criminal forfeiture limited to property defendant obtained from crime; cannot forfeit co-defendant's property.

**Application:** Limits government's forfeiture power, but doesn't protect defendant's own property.

---

### C. Trust Protection Cases

#### Scheffel v. Krueger, 782 A.2d 410 (N.H. 2001)

**Facts:** Creditor sought to reach debtor's interest in spendthrift trust.

**Holding:** Valid spendthrift trust prevents creditors from reaching trust assets even if beneficiary is also settlor (in Alaska/Delaware jurisdictions).

**Application:** Properly structured self-settled trust CAN protect assets from creditors in some jurisdictions.

---

#### In re Huber, 493 B.R. 798 (Bankr. W.D. Wash. 2013)

**Facts:** Debtor created self-settled spendthrift trust; bankruptcy trustee sought to reach assets.

**Holding:** Self-settled trusts in non-asset-protection jurisdictions do NOT protect assets in bankruptcy.

**Application:** Trust structure and state law determine bankruptcy protection.

---

## IV. Recommended Asset Protection Amendments

### Amendment 1: Bankruptcy Exemption and Tribal Property Characterization (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Insert After Section 6 (Inalienability), Add New Section 6.7:**

```markdown
**6.7 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AND TRIBAL PROPERTY CHARACTERIZATION**

a) **CHARACTERIZATION AS TRIBAL CULTURAL PROPERTY:**
   
   The intellectual property rights, Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, and cultural heritage embodied in the Work constitute **tribal cultural property** held by the Rights Holder in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of:
   i) The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians
   ii) The Anishinaabe people generally
   iii) Future generations of Indigenous peoples
   iv) The broader Indigenous community
   
   As tribal cultural property, these assets are:
   - NOT solely personal property of the Rights Holder
   - Held in trust-like capacity with inalienable duties
   - Subject to cultural protocols and community interests
   - Protected by federal Indian law and tribal sovereignty principles

b) **BANKRUPTCY EXEMPTION CLAIMS:**
   
   In the event the Rights Holder files bankruptcy (voluntary or involuntary), the following exemptions apply:
   
   i) **Federal Bankruptcy Exemptions (11 U.S.C. § 522(d)):**
       To the extent Rights Holder elects federal exemptions, claim exemption under:
       (1) § 522(d)(11)(D) - "professionally prescribed health aids"
           - Traditional Knowledge of medicines and healing is health-related
           - Cultural and spiritual health integral to Indigenous wellbeing
       (2) § 522(d)(11)(E) - burial plots
           - Sacred sites have burial-plot-like cultural significance
       (3) § 522(d)(12) - retirement funds to extent reasonably necessary
           - Legacy Trust for future generations analogous to retirement planning
   
   ii) **State Bankruptcy Exemptions (Michigan):**
       If Michigan exemptions elected (MCL 600.6023), claim:
       (1) Tools of trade exemption (MCL 600.6023(g)) - IP is "tool" of creator's profession
       (2) Necessary items (MCL 600.6023(a)) - cultural heritage necessary for identity
       (3) Household goods of sentimental value
   
   iii) **Tribal Law Exemptions:**
       GTBOCI tribal law (to extent recognized by bankruptcy court) exempts tribal cultural property from alienation or creditor claims as matter of tribal sovereignty and cultural protection

c) **11 U.S.C. § 541(c)(2) TRUST PROTECTION:**
   
   To the extent the Work is held in trust (Living Trust per Section 9A or Legacy Trust per Section 10.3):
   
   i) Trust assets are NOT property of Rights Holder's bankruptcy estate if trust is validly created and irrevocable
   ii) Spendthrift provisions in trust prevent creditor access
   iii) Bankruptcy Code § 541(c)(2) respects transfer restrictions enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law
   iv) Tribal law restrictions on cultural property alienation are "applicable nonbankruptcy law"

d) **TRIBAL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY PREVENTS ESTATE INCLUSION:**
   
   To the extent the Work is characterized as tribal governmental property:
   i) Tribal sovereign immunity prevents bankruptcy trustee from asserting control
   ii) Tribal property held by individual cannot be reached by non-tribal creditors
   iii) Federal bankruptcy courts must respect tribal sovereignty
   iv) Rights Holder holds legal title but beneficial ownership is tribal

e) **§ 365 EXECUTORY CONTRACT PROTECTION:**
   
   If this license is deemed "executory contract" under 11 U.S.C. § 365:
   
   i) **Anti-Assignment Clause** (§ 365(c)):
       This license is **non-assignable** under applicable law (tribal law, federal Indian law, license terms). Therefore, bankruptcy trustee:
       (1) Cannot assume license and assign to third party
       (2) Must either assume license in Rights Holder's favor or reject entirely
       (3) Rejection terminates license but does NOT transfer IP rights to trustee
   
   ii) **IP License Protection** (§ 365(n)):
       To extent Work includes copyrighted software or technology licenses:
       (1) Licensees have § 365(n) protections
       (2) But this license is FROM Rights Holder TO users, so Rights Holder is licensor
       (3) If trustee rejects license, users may elect to retain rights under § 365(n)
       (4) Rejection does NOT terminate existing licenses

f) **STRATEGIC BANKRUPTCY PLANNING:**
   
   To maximize asset protection in potential bankruptcy:
   
   i) **Pre-Bankruptcy Trust Funding:**
       Rights Holder should transfer IP assets to irrevocable trust BEFORE financial distress (not in contemplation of bankruptcy to avoid fraudulent transfer claims)
   
   ii) **Homestead and Other Exemptions:**
       Maximize use of available exemptions for non-IP assets to preserve them
   
   iii) **Chapter 11 Reorganization Preference:**
       If bankruptcy necessary, Chapter 11 reorganization preferable to Chapter 7 liquidation:
       (1) Rights Holder retains control as debtor-in-possession
       (2) Can negotiate plan preserving IP rights
       (3) Creditors take reduced payment over time rather than forced asset sale
   
   iv) **Tribal Court Bankruptcy Alternative:**
       Consider whether GTBOCI tribal courts offer alternative insolvency procedures recognizing cultural property protections

g) **CREDITOR NOTIFICATION IN LICENSE:**
   
   All parties are on notice that:
   i) Inalienability provisions in this license create defect in title for any attempted transfer
   ii) Creditors attempting to levy on IP rights take subject to this license
   iii) Any purchase at foreclosure/bankruptcy sale takes subject to license restrictions
   iv) IP rights cannot be transferred free and clear of license encumbrance
   v) Attempting to circumvent inalienability may constitute interference with tribal cultural property

h) **FEDERAL INDIAN LAW SUPREMACY IN BANKRUPTCY:**
   
   Federal Indian law providing special protections for tribal cultural property supersedes general bankruptcy law under:
   i) Federal preemption doctrine (*Worcester v. Georgia*)
   ii) Indian canons of construction (resolve ambiguities in favor of tribes)
   iii) Federal trust responsibility to protect tribal cultural resources
   iv) Treaty rights preserving Indigenous intellectual and cultural property
   
   Bankruptcy courts must apply federal Indian law exceptions to standard bankruptcy rules where tribal cultural property involved.
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Characterizes IP as tribal cultural property, not purely personal asset
- Claims available bankruptcy exemptions (federal and state)
- Invokes § 541(c)(2) trust protection
- Uses § 365 executory contract rules to prevent assignment
- Relies on federal Indian law supremacy
- Provides strategic bankruptcy planning guidance
- Puts creditors on notice of title defect

---

### Amendment 2: Criminal Restitution Exemption and Garnishment Limits (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Insert After Section 6.3(g) (existing incarceration provisions), Add New 6.3(g-1):**

```markdown
**6.3(g-1) CRIMINAL RESTITUTION EXEMPTION AND GARNISHMENT LIMITS:**

a) **PARTIAL PAYMENT LIMITATION:**
   
   Notwithstanding any court order for criminal restitution, fines, fees, or victim compensation:
   
   i) **Maximum Garnishment:**
       License proceeds may be garnished for criminal restitution up to maximum of:
       (1) 25% of monthly proceeds (consistent with federal wage garnishment limits, 15 U.S.C. § 1673)
       (2) OR amount by which proceeds exceed 30 times federal minimum wage, whichever is less
   
   ii) **Minimum Protected Amount:**
       At least 75% of license proceeds (or amount equivalent to 30x federal minimum wage) shall continue flowing to Legacy Beneficiary despite restitution orders
   
   iii) **Temporary Garnishment Only:**
       Garnishment is temporary payment mechanism only; does NOT constitute:
       (1) Permanent transfer of IP rights
       (2) Assignment of license to victims
       (3) Sale of intellectual property
       (4) Alienation of inalienable rights
       (5) Modification of license terms

b) **NO PERMANENT FORFEITURE OF IP RIGHTS:**
   
   Under 18 U.S.C. § 982 (criminal forfeiture) and 21 U.S.C. § 853 (drug-related forfeiture):
   
   i) **IP Rights NOT Substitutable Assets:**
       Intellectual property rights in the Work are NOT "substitute assets" subject to forfeiture because:
       (1) They are tribal cultural property held in trust-like capacity
       (2) Inalienability prevents ownership transfer
       (3) Federal Indian law protects tribal cultural resources
       (4) They were not acquired with proceeds of criminal activity (created through traditional knowledge and cultural expression)
   
   ii) **Cultural Property Exception:**
       Tribal cultural property is categorically exempt from criminal forfeiture as:
       (1) Property held for benefit of third parties (tribe, community, future generations)
       (2) Property with no ascertainable market value (cultural significance transcends economics)
       (3) Property protected by federal trust responsibility
   
   iii) **Third-Party Interest:**
       Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and Legacy Beneficiary Trust have bona fide "third-party interest" in the Work under 21 U.S.C. § 853(n), preventing forfeiture

c) **STATE RESTITUTION PREEMPTION:**
   
   To the extent state criminal courts order restitution or asset forfeiture:
   
   i) **Federal Indian Law Preempts:**
       State criminal law cannot override federal protections for tribal cultural property under:
       (1) *Worcester v. Georgia* (state law does not apply to Indian property)
       (2) Federal trust responsibility to protect tribal assets
       (3) Constitutional supremacy of federal Indian law
   
   ii) **Tribal Court Jurisdiction:**
       State criminal court jurisdiction over Rights Holder (tribal member) may be limited depending on:
       (1) Location of crime (Indian Country vs. non-Indian Country)
       (2) Victim identity (Indian vs. non-Indian)
       (3) Post-*Castro-Huerta* jurisdiction issues
       Rights Holder may challenge state restitution orders on jurisdictional grounds
   
   iii) **Michigan-Specific:**
       In Michigan (where GTBOCI located), state restitution orders affecting tribal cultural property must be reviewed for:
       (1) Compliance with federal-tribal compacts
       (2) Respect for tribal sovereignty
       (3) Proportionality to actual victim harm

d) **VICTIM COMPENSATION ALTERNATIVE:**
   
   Rather than permanent transfer or excessive garnishment, Rights Holder may propose alternative victim compensation:
   
   i) **Structured Payment Plan:**
       Monthly payments from license proceeds over extended period (10-20 years)
   
   ii) **Cultural Work in Lieu:**
       Provide educational programs, cultural presentations, or community service related to Traditional Knowledge as restitution
   
   iii) **Benefit-Sharing with Victims:**
       Victims receive percentage of future license proceeds, similar to beneficiaries, but WITHOUT ownership rights
   
   iv) **Insurance Proceeds:**
       If Rights Holder maintains errors & omissions or professional liability insurance, insurance proceeds cover restitution rather than IP assets

e) **RIGHTS HOLDER RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESTITUTION:**
   
   While IP rights are protected from permanent alienation:
   
   i) Rights Holder remains personally liable for restitution from OTHER assets
   ii) Rights Holder should exhaust non-IP assets before IP-derived proceeds garnished
   iii) IP protection is defensive measure, not shield from legitimate victim compensation
   iv) Courts should seek satisfaction from non-cultural-property assets first

f) **PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS IN SENTENCING:**
   
   During criminal sentencing proceedings where restitution ordered:
   
   i) **Notice to Tribal Authorities:**
       Rights Holder shall notify GTBOCI Tribal Attorney General of pending sentencing
   
   ii) **Tribal Amicus Participation:**
       GTBOCI may file amicus brief in sentencing arguing:
       (1) Tribal cultural property exempt from forfeiture
       (2) Federal Indian law limits restitution scope
       (3) Alternative compensation structures available
   
   iii) **Cultural Expert Testimony:**
       Rights Holder may present expert testimony on:
       (1) Cultural significance of IP rights
       (2) Inalienability under tribal law
       (3) Community interests in preserving Traditional Knowledge
       (4) Economic harm to Legacy Beneficiary from excessive garnishment
   
   iv) **Sentencing Memorandum:**
       Rights Holder's counsel shall submit memorandum arguing for:
       (1) Partial payment limits (25% maximum garnishment)
       (2) No permanent IP transfer
       (3) Alternative compensation mechanisms
       (4) Federal Indian law protections

g) **LEGACY BENEFICIARY INTERVENTION:**
   
   Legacy Beneficiary Trust (Section 10.3) has standing to intervene in criminal proceedings to protect trust interests:
   
   i) Trustee may file motion to intervene under Fed. R. Crim. P. 17
   ii) Trustee represents beneficiaries' interests in preserving trust corpus
   iii) Trustee can argue restitution impairs trust's ability to fulfill educational mission
   iv) Trustee can propose alternative payment structures protecting trust

h) **INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS:**
   
   If Rights Holder faces criminal proceedings in foreign jurisdiction:
   i) US State Department diplomatic intervention requested (government-to-government)
   ii) Tribal sovereignty principles asserted through diplomatic channels
   iii) International human rights protections invoked (UNDRIP Article 7)
   iv) Extradition treaties may provide protections for tribal members
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Limits garnishment to federal wage garnishment standards (15 U.S.C. § 1673)
- Distinguishes temporary garnishment from permanent alienation
- Invokes federal Indian law preemption of state restitution
- Uses third-party interest exception to criminal forfeiture
- Provides alternative compensation structures
- Creates procedural protections in sentencing
- Allows tribal government and Legacy Beneficiary intervention

---

### Amendment 3: Automatic Succession Triggering Procedures (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Replace Section 13.7(a) With Enhanced Version:**

```markdown
**13.7(a) AUTOMATIC SUCCESSION ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:**

i) **TRIGGERING EVENTS:**
   Automatic succession of license authorities activates upon ANY of the following:
   
   (1) **Confirmed Incarceration** - Rights Holder confined in jail, prison, detention center, or correctional facility for period exceeding 72 consecutive hours;
   
   (2) **Arbitrary Detention** - Rights Holder detained without formal charges or due process for any period;
   
   (3) **Medical Incapacity** - Rights Holder unable to manage license affairs due to physical or mental incapacity as determined by two licensed physicians;
   
   (4) **Judicial Incapacity** - Court determines Rights Holder incompetent or appoints guardian/conservator;
   
   (5) **Disappearance** - Rights Holder missing or whereabouts unknown for 30 consecutive days;
   
   (6) **Communication Interruption** - Rights Holder unable to communicate with financial institutions or trustees for 14 consecutive days despite reasonable attempts;

ii) **CONFIRMATION PROCEDURES:**
   "Confirmed" triggering event means verification through any of:

## VI. Conclusion

The license's **asset protection provisions are comprehensive but contain critical enforcement gaps** when confronted with federal bankruptcy law, criminal restitution statutes, and corrections regulations. The recommended amendments:

1. **Characterize IP as tribal cultural property** - Stronger bankruptcy protection
2. **Limit criminal garnishment to 25%** - Balances victim compensation with asset preservation
3. **Create detailed succession procedures** - Ensures smooth transition during incarceration
4. **Establish notification systems** - Prevents successor authority delays
5. **Define successor scope and limits** - Prevents overreach while enabling protection

**Risk Reduction:** Implementing these amendments reduces asset protection vulnerabilities from **MEDIUM-HIGH** to **LOW-MEDIUM**, providing practical mechanisms for protecting assets during extraordinary circumstances while acknowledging legal limitations of contract terms against federal law.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Living trust must be established BEFORE financial distress
- Successor designations must be current and documented
- Tribal government coordination essential for intervention
- Rights Holder should maintain non-IP assets for creditor satisfaction
- Proactive planning more effective than reactive protection
