# Sovereign Immunity & Jurisdiction Analysis & Amendments

**Document:** 04-sovereign-immunity-jurisdiction.md  
**Priority Level:** CRITICAL  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## I. Current License Provisions - Sovereign Immunity & Jurisdiction

### A. Tribal Sovereign Immunity (Section 12.1, Lines 89-92)

**Current Language:**
> "Nothing in this license shall be construed as a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians or any other tribal nation. Consistent with Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751 (1998), tribal sovereign immunity is explicitly preserved and protected under this license."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Explicitly invokes Kiowa Tribe
- ✓ States no waiver of immunity
- ⚠ But other provisions may create implicit waiver
- ⚠ Section 11.6 (enforcement costs) could be construed as consent to money judgment
- ⚠ Section 12 (audit rights) might imply consent to process
- ⚠ Unclear if trust activities create "commercial activity" exception

### B. Tribal Court Jurisdiction (Section 12.1(a), Lines 89-91)

**Current Language:**
> "The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians tribal courts shall have primary and preferred jurisdiction over all disputes arising under this license..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Declares tribal court primacy
- ✓ Requires exhaustion (Section 11.1A, Lines 1376-1378)
- ⚠ Does NOT analyze Montana v. United States basis
- ⚠ Missing consent-to-jurisdiction language from users
- ⚠ No procedural specifications for tribal court proceedings

### C. Forum Selection & Jurisdictional Breach (Section 11, Lines 1214-1248)

**Current Language:**
> "By accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with the Work, you (the 'User') irrevocably agree that this license constitutes a binding contract..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Strong forum selection language
- ✓ Liquidated damages for breach ($100,000)
- ⚠ Contract formation unclear (when does "acceptance" occur?)
- ⚠ Liquidated damages may be challenged as penalty
- ⚠ Unclear enforcement mechanism if defendant files in wrong forum

### D. Secondary Jurisdiction (Section 12.2, Lines 94-95)

**Current Language:**
> "Federal courts may exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising under this license only in cases where: (i) tribal courts lack jurisdiction under applicable tribal law..."

**Analysis:**
- ✓ Federal court as backup
- ✓ Preserves tribal court primacy
- ⚠ Doesn't specify which federal courts (district, court of claims?)
- ⚠ Missing federal question jurisdiction analysis
- ⚠ No discussion of removal procedures

---

## II. Critical Sovereign Immunity & Jurisdiction Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability 1: Implicit Waiver Through Enforcement Provisions

**Issue:** While Section 12.1 explicitly preserves sovereign immunity, other license provisions may create **implicit waiver**.

**Problematic Provisions:**

#### A. Section 11.6 - Enforcement Costs

**Current Language (Line 1243):**
> "Any party found to be in breach of this license shall be liable for all reasonable costs incurred by the Rights Holder (or their successor) in enforcing the license, including attorneys' fees, court costs, investigation expenses, and expert witness fees."

**Problem:**
- "Successor" could include tribal trust or tribal entity
- Seeking "costs incurred by" tribal entity could be construed as consent to counterclaims
- Money judgment against violator could lead to counterclaim for money judgment against tribe

**Case Law:**
*C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe*, 532 U.S. 411 (2001):
- Tribe that sues in state court for money damages **waives immunity** to compulsory counterclaims
- Waiver extends to claims "arising out of same transaction"
- Applies even if tribe didn't expressly consent

**Application:**
If tribal entity enforces license and seeks money damages, defendant may assert counterclaim and tribal immunity could be waived for that counterclaim.

---

#### B. Section 12 - Audit Rights

**Current Language (Lines 1249-1252):**
> "The Rights Holder, or their designated successor authority or the Trust established under Section 10.3 (hereafter 'Auditing Party'), shall have the right, upon providing reasonable written notice (no less than 10 business days), to audit and inspect the records, systems, facilities, and practices..."

**Problem:**
- Trust or tribal entity conducting audits may be subject to process
- Audit process could be characterized as "commercial activity"
- Defendant could argue immunity waived for audit-related disputes

**Case Law:**
*Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community*, 572 U.S. 782 (2014):
- Sovereign immunity applies even to off-reservation commercial activity
- BUT commercial activity exception exists in some contexts
- Courts scrutinize whether activity is "governmental" or "commercial"

**Application:**
License enforcement and auditing could be characterized as commercial activity, potentially creating immunity exception.

---

### Vulnerability 2: Individual vs. Tribal Capacity Confusion

**Issue:** License doesn't clearly distinguish when Rights Holder acts in **individual capacity** vs. when **tribal government** acts.

**Critical Questions:**

1. **Who is the licensor?**
   - Individual tribal member (Rights Holder)?
   - Tribal government?
   - Both jointly?

2. **Who can sue for violations?**
   - Rights Holder individually?
   - Tribal government on Rights Holder's behalf?
   - Trust (which may or may not have sovereign immunity)?

3. **Who can be sued?**
   - Rights Holder individually (yes)
   - Tribal government (only if immunity waived)
   - Trust (depends on structure)

**Problem:**
Ambiguity creates risk that tribal government could be:
- Involuntarily joined as defendant
- Subject to counterclaims
- Found to have waived immunity

**Case Law:**
*Breakthrough Management Group, Inc. v. Chukchansi Gold Casino and Resort*, 629 F.3d 1173 (10th Cir. 2010):
- Individuals acting in official capacity for tribe are protected by sovereign immunity
- BUT individuals acting in personal capacity are not protected
- Distinction turns on whether activity is governmental function

---

### Vulnerability 3: Forum Selection Clause Enforceability

**Issue:** Forum selection clause (Section 11) may not be enforceable without clear **contract formation** and **mutual assent**.

**Forum Selection Requirements (Bremen v. Zapata, 407 U.S. 1 (1972)):**

1. **Reasonable Notice:** User must have reasonable notice of forum selection clause
2. **Mutual Assent:** Both parties must agree to clause
3. **Not Unreasonable:** Forum must not be so inconvenient as to be unreasonable
4. **Not Result of Fraud:** Clause must not result from fraud or overreaching

**Current License Issues:**

#### A. When Does Acceptance Occur?

**Current Language (Line 1214):**
> "By accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with the Work, you (the 'User') irrevocably agree..."

**Problem:**
- "Accessing" the Work = agreement?
- What if user accesses inadvertently?
- What if Work is publicly posted (e.g., GitHub)?
- No affirmative acceptance mechanism (click-through, signature, etc.)

**Case Law:**
*Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.*, 306 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 2002):
- "Browsewrap" agreements (terms accessible via link) often unenforceable
- Requires actual or constructive notice + assent
- User must take affirmative action indicating agreement

**Application:**
If user can access Work without affirmative acceptance, forum selection may be unenforceable.

---

#### B. Unconscionability Risk

**Challenge:**
Sophisticated defendant might argue forum selection clause is unconscionable:
- Tribal court unfamiliar forum
- Expensive travel to reservation
- Lack of tribal court infrastructure
- Procedural unfairness

**Defense:**
- Federal law encourages tribal court jurisdiction (exhaustion doctrine)
- Users have notice of terms before using
- Users can decline to use Work
- Backup federal court jurisdiction available

**Current License:**
Doesn't address unconscionability concerns or explain reasonableness of tribal forum.

---

### Vulnerability 4: Liquidated Damages as Penalty

**Issue:** $100,000 liquidated damages for jurisdictional breach (Section 11.8) may be struck as **unenforceable penalty**.

**Liquidated Damages Requirements:**

**Valid IF:**
1. Damages difficult to estimate at time of contracting
2. Amount is reasonable forecast of actual damages
3. Not grossly disproportionate to probable loss

**Invalid (Penalty) IF:**
- Amount bears no relationship to actual harm
- Designed purely to deter breach
- Grossly disproportionate to any conceivable loss

**Current License Issues:**

**Line 1247:**
> "...you shall be immediately liable to the Rights Holder or their successor for liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred thousand U.S. dollars ($100,000 USD), which you agree is a reasonable and genuine pre-estimate of the damages and not a penalty."

**Problems:**
1. **No Supporting Calculation:** Why $100,000? Based on what costs?
2. **Same for All Violators:** $100,000 for individual or Fortune 500 company?
3. **Actual Harm May Be Less:** Costs of removal to federal court typically $5,000-$20,000
4. **May Appear Punitive:** Designed to deter rather than compensate

**Case Law:**
*Kemble v. Farren*, 6 Bing. 141 (1829) (classic formulation):
- Liquidated damages valid if genuine pre-estimate of loss
- Invalid if in terrorem (to terrify into compliance)

**Modern Application:**
Courts scrutinize liquidated damages, especially when grossly disproportionate to actual harm.

---

### Vulnerability 5: Federal Question Jurisdiction Ambiguity

**Issue:** License doesn't clearly establish **federal question jurisdiction** as basis for federal court backup.

**Federal Question Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331):**
> "The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."

**Potential Federal Questions:**

1. **Federal Indian Law:**
   - Treaty rights (1836, 1855 treaties)
   - Indian Arts and Crafts Act (25 U.S.C. § 305)
   - Tribal sovereignty principles

2. **Federal Copyright/IP:**
   - Copyright Act claims (if applicable)
   - Lanham Act (trademark)
   - Patent law (if relevant)

3. **Federal Statutes:**
   - CFAA (18 U.S.C. § 1030)
   - DTSA (18 U.S.C. § 1836)

**Current License:**
- Mentions federal law basis generally
- Doesn't clearly plead federal question for jurisdictional purposes
- May result in dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction

---

### Vulnerability 6: Removal to Federal Court Procedures Unspecified

**Issue:** If defendant files in state court (violating forum selection), license doesn't specify removal procedures.

**Removal Statute (28 U.S.C. § 1441):**
> "Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant..."

**Removal Grounds:**

1. **Federal Question (§ 1441(a)):**
   - Claim arises under federal law
   - Available if federal question jurisdiction exists

2. **Diversity (§ 1441(b)):**
   - Complete diversity of citizenship
   - Amount in controversy exceeds $75,000
   - Tribal members may be citizens of tribe, not state (ambiguous)

**Current License:**
- Doesn't instruct Rights Holder to remove if defendant files in state court
- Doesn't preserve removal rights
- Could result in state court proceeding in violation of forum selection

---

## III. Sovereign Immunity & Jurisdiction Case Law Analysis

### A. Tribal Sovereign Immunity Cases

#### 1. Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S. 751 (1998)

**Holding:** Tribes have sovereign immunity from suit even for off-reservation commercial activities, absent Congressional abrogation or tribal waiver.

**Key Principles:**
- Sovereign immunity is jurisdictional - court lacks power to hear case
- Applies to tribes as governments, not individual tribal members
- Applies in both federal and state courts
- Only Congress can abrogate (or tribe can waive)

**Application to License:**
- GTBOCI has sovereign immunity as tribal government
- If tribal government enforces license, immune from counterclaims
- BUT individual Rights Holder not protected by tribal immunity
- Trust structure determines whether trust has immunity

**Current License:** ✓ Correctly invokes Kiowa

---

#### 2. Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782 (2014)

**Holding:** Sovereign immunity bars state suit against tribe for operating off-reservation casino, even if activity violates state law.

**Key Principles:**
- Immunity applies to commercial activity
- States cannot sue tribes without consent
- Remedies limited to actions against tribal officials (Ex parte Young) or suits affecting federal interests

**Application to License:**
- Even if license enforcement characterized as "commercial," tribe retains immunity
- Users cannot sue tribe for license-related disputes
- Individual Rights Holder may be sueable, but tribe is not

**Current License:** Partially addressed; needs clarification of individual vs. tribal capacity

---

#### 3. C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 532 U.S. 411 (2001)

**Holding:** Tribe that sues in state court for money damages waives immunity as to compulsory counterclaims arising from same transaction.

**Key Principles:**
- Voluntary invocation of jurisdiction = immunity waiver
- Waiver limited to "compulsory" counterclaims (same transaction/occurrence)
- Does NOT extend to permissive counterclaims (unrelated claims)

**Application to License:**
- If tribal entity sues for license violations, may waive immunity to related counterclaims
- If Rights Holder (individual) sues, no tribal immunity to waive
- Structure matters: individual enforcement vs. tribal enforcement

**Current License:** NOT addressed - creates vulnerability

---

### B. Forum Selection & Tribal Court Jurisdiction

#### 4. National Farmers Union Insurance Cos. v. Crow Tribe of Indians, 471 U.S. 845 (1985)

**Holding:** Party challenging tribal court jurisdiction must first exhaust tribal court remedies before seeking federal court review.

**Key Principles:**
- Tribal court exhaustion required (with exceptions)
- Federal courts defer to tribal courts on jurisdictional questions
- Exhaustion promotes tribal sovereignty and self-determination

**Application to License:**
- Exhaustion requirement strengthens tribal court forum selection
- Defendants must litigate in tribal court first
- Federal review available only after tribal proceedings concluded

**Current License:** ✓ Correctly requires exhaustion (Section 11.1A)

---

#### 5. Montana v. United States, 450 U.S. 544 (1981)

**Holding:** Tribes generally lack civil jurisdiction over non-members on non-tribal land, UNLESS:
1. Non-member has consensual relationship with tribe/member, OR
2. Conduct threatens tribal self-government, economic security, or welfare

**Application to License:**
- License creates consensual relationship (Montana exception 1)
- IP misappropriation threatens tribal cultural integrity (Montana exception 2)
- Both exceptions support tribal court jurisdiction

**Current License:** NOT explicitly analyzed - see Federal Indian Law document for detailed treatment

---

#### 6. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585 (1991)

**Holding:** Forum selection clause in ticket of adhesion valid if reasonable notice given and not result of fraud.

**Key Principles:**
- Forum selection clauses generally enforceable
- Reasonable notice required
- Can be in boilerplate/adhesion contract if conspicuous
- Court will not enforce if unreasonable or unjust

**Application to License:**
- Supports tribal court forum selection IF users have notice
- Must be conspicuous and not procedurally unconscionable
- Reasonableness of tribal forum may be questioned but supported by federal policy

**Current License:** Implied by forum selection language but could be strengthened

---

### C. Liquidated Damages Cases

#### 7. Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney, 66 Ohio St. 3d 376 (1993)

**Holding:** Liquidated damages valid if: (1) damages difficult to estimate, and (2) amount reasonable forecast of probable loss.

**Application to License:**
- Must show jurisdictional breach causes difficult-to-quantify harm
- Must support $100,000 with calculation
- Cultural harm, sovereignty harm, litigation costs must be quantified

**Current License:** Lacks supporting calculation

---

## IV. Recommended Sovereign Immunity & Jurisdiction Amendments

### Amendment 1: Individual vs. Tribal Capacity Clarification (CRITICAL)

**Insert After Section 2 (Declaration of Name Usage), Expand Section 2.1:**

```markdown
**2.1 COMPREHENSIVE CAPACITY CLARIFICATION AND SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY PRESERVATION**

a) **DUAL CAPACITY OF RIGHTS HOLDER:**
   
   The Rights Holder, ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, acts under this license in the following distinct capacities:
   
   i) **PRIMARY CAPACITY - Individual Licensor**:
       (1) Acts as individual creator and owner of the Work
       (2) Grants licenses in personal capacity
       (3) May pursue enforcement actions as individual plaintiff
       (4) Subject to personal jurisdiction in appropriate forums
       (5) Individual assets may be subject to judgment (subject to inalienability protections)
   
   ii) **SECONDARY CAPACITY - Tribal Member and Cultural Steward**:
       (1) Acts as enrolled member of Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians
       (2) Exercises rights protected by federal Indian law and treaties
       (3) Stewards Traditional Knowledge on behalf of broader Indigenous community
       (4) Subject to tribal law and cultural protocols
       (5) Benefits from federal trust responsibility and treaty protections

b) **TRIBAL GOVERNMENT NON-PARTY STATUS:**
   
   i) **No Tribal Government Liability**:
       The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians ("GTBOCI") tribal government is **NOT** a party to this license in any capacity, including:
       (1) NOT a licensor or grantor of rights
       (2) NOT guarantor or surety for Rights Holder's obligations
       (3) NOT liable for Rights Holder's representations or warranties
       (4) NOT subject to suit for license-related disputes
       (5) NOT holder of intellectual property rights in the Work (except to extent cultural property laws apply)
   
   ii) **Tribal Sovereign Immunity Absolute**:
       GTBOCI tribal government and all tribal governmental entities retain absolute sovereign immunity from suit under *Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.*, 523 U.S. 751 (1998), and *Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community*, 572 U.S. 782 (2014). Nothing in this license:
       (1) Constitutes waiver of tribal sovereign immunity
       (2) Creates cause of action against tribal government
       (3) Permits joinder of tribal government as party
       (4) Allows service of process on tribal government
       (5) Subjects tribal assets to execution or attachment
   
   iii) **Tribal Court Jurisdiction Distinct from Liability**:
       GTBOCI tribal courts have jurisdiction over disputes under this license pursuant to tribal sovereignty, NOT because tribe is party to disputes. Tribal court jurisdiction derives from:
       (1) Tribe's inherent sovereignty over member activities
       (2) *Montana v. United States* exceptions (consensual relationships, conduct affecting tribe)
       (3) User consent to jurisdiction through license acceptance
       (4) Federal Indian law recognizing tribal adjudicatory authority

c) **TRUST AND SUCCESSOR AUTHORITY STATUS:**
   
   i) **Living Trust (Section 9A.1)**:
       (1) Trust operates for benefit of Rights Holder during lifetime
       (2) Trust is separate legal entity from tribal government
       (3) Trust does NOT possess tribal sovereign immunity unless explicitly structured as tribal governmental entity
       (4) Financial institution serving as trustee operates in commercial capacity without sovereign immunity
       (5) Trust may pursue enforcement actions without implicating tribal immunity
   
   ii) **Legacy Trust (Section 10.3)**:
       (1) Legacy Trust established posthumously is separate entity
       (2) If established as tribal trust under GTBOCI law: MAY possess sovereign immunity
       (3) If established as federal/state law trust: Does NOT possess sovereign immunity
       (4) Trust structure determination made by Rights Holder or successor authority
       (5) Sovereign immunity status (if any) explicitly stated in trust instrument
   
   iii) **Successor Authority Capacity**:
       Successor authorities designated under Section 10.2 act in following capacities:
       (1) If individual designated successor: Individual capacity without sovereign immunity
       (2) If tribal office designated successor (e.g., THPO): Official capacity WITH sovereign immunity
       (3) If trust designated successor: Immunity status per trust structure
       (4) Capacity explicitly identified in each enforcement action

d) **ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND IMMUNITY PRESERVATION:**
   
   i) **Individual Enforcement (Preferred Method)**:
       (1) Rights Holder pursues claims in individual capacity
       (2) No tribal sovereign immunity invoked or waived
       (3) Defendant may assert defenses against individual
       (4) Defendant may NOT implead or join tribal government
       (5) Individual judgment does not affect tribal government
   
   ii) **Tribal Entity Enforcement (When Authorized)**:
       (1) Tribal government MAY, at its sole discretion, pursue enforcement on Rights Holder's behalf
       (2) Such action requires explicit tribal council resolution
       (3) Tribe acts as real party in interest asserting its own governmental interests
       (4) Sovereign immunity fully applies
       (5) Defendant may NOT assert counterclaims against tribe absent explicit immunity waiver in resolution
   
   iii) **Trust Enforcement (Posthumous or Delegated)**:
       (1) Trust pursues claims in trust capacity
       (2) Sovereign immunity status per subsection (c) above
       (3) Trust fiduciary duties govern enforcement decisions
       (4) Defendant may assert defenses/counterclaims against trust (if no immunity)
       (5) Judgments against trust limited to trust assets

e) **C & L ENTERPRISES WAIVER PREVENTION:**
   
   To avoid inadvertent waiver of tribal sovereign immunity under *C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe*, 532 U.S. 411 (2001):
   
   i) **Tribal Enforcement Limited Circumstances**:
       Tribal government will enforce license ONLY when:
       (1) Explicit tribal council resolution authorizes specific action
       (2) Resolution states limited scope of immunity waiver (if any)
       (3) Enforcement advances governmental interests (cultural protection, sovereignty)
       (4) Individual/trust enforcement inadequate or unavailable
   
   ii) **Federal Court Preference for Tribal Actions**:
       If tribe enforces, preference for federal court jurisdiction to:
       (1) Avoid state court compulsory counterclaim waiver
       (2) Ensure federal Indian law governs
       (3) Preserve tribal sovereignty protections
       (4) Federal courts more familiar with tribal immunity doctrine
   
   iii) **Prohibition on State Court Tribal Actions**:
       Tribal government shall NOT sue in state court for license violations to avoid *C & L Enterprises* waiver. Tribal actions limited to:
       (1) Tribal court (tribe's own forum)
       (2) Federal court (federal question jurisdiction)
       (3) International arbitration (if applicable)
   
   iv) **Counterclaim Immunity Reservation**:
       Any tribal enforcement action explicitly states:
       "Plaintiff Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians appears solely to assert its governmental interests in protecting cultural heritage and tribal sovereignty. Plaintiff does not waive sovereign immunity as to any counterclaims, whether compulsory or permissive. Defendant may assert defenses to plaintiff's claims but may not seek affirmative relief against plaintiff."

f) **AUDIT RIGHTS AND IMMUNITY PRESERVATION:**
   
   Section 12 (Audit Rights) clarified:
   
   i) **Audit Conducted by Trust/Individual**:
       (1) Audits conducted by individual Rights Holder or Trust (not tribal government)
       (2) Auditing party does not possess sovereign immunity (unless trust structured tribally)
       (3) Defendant may assert defenses to audit (procedural challenges, confidentiality)
       (4) Defendant may NOT sue tribal government based on audit
   
   ii) **Tribal Government Information Requests Distinct**:
       (1) If GTBOCI government requests information about license compliance, such request is governmental regulatory action
       (2) Sovereign immunity applies to regulatory information requests
       (3) Non-compliance may subject violator to tribal court proceedings
       (4) No waiver of immunity through regulatory oversight

g) **ENFORCEMENT COSTS AND IMMUNITY:**
   
   Section 11.6 (Enforcement Costs) clarified:
   
   i) **Costs Payable to Individual/Trust**:
       (1) Enforcement costs payable to Rights Holder (individual) or Trust
       (2) NOT payable to tribal government (preserving immunity)
       (3) If tribe enforces, costs paid to tribe are governmental function
       (4) Defendant may NOT offset or counterclaim against such costs
   
   ii) **No Counterclaim Rights Created**:
       Award of enforcement costs does NOT create counterclaim rights. Defendant may:
       (1) Contest whether costs are "reasonable" (substantive defense)
       (2) Challenge whether plaintiff "prevailed" (threshold issue)
       (3) NOT assert counterclaims for defendant's own costs absent separate legal basis

h) **USER ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF IMMUNITY PRINCIPLES:**
   
   By using the Work under this license, users explicitly acknowledge and agree:
   
   i) Grand Traverse Band tribal government is not party to this license
   ii) Tribal government retains absolute sovereign immunity
   iii) Users may NOT sue, implead, or join tribal government in any proceeding
   iv) Users may NOT seek discovery from tribal government absent tribal consent
   v) Tribal court jurisdiction does not waive tribal immunity
   vi) Any attempt to sue tribal government is void ab initio
   vii) Tribal immunity extends to tribal officials acting in official capacity
   viii) Litigation costs of defending improper tribal suits borne by violating user
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Clearly separates individual Rights Holder from tribal government
- Explicitly preserves tribal sovereign immunity
- Prevents C & L Enterprises inadvertent waiver
- Clarifies trust status regarding immunity
- Provides procedural safeguards for tribal enforcement
- Creates user acknowledgment of immunity principles

### Amendment 2: Enhanced Forum Selection and Contract Formation (CRITICAL)

**Replace Section 11 (Lines 1214-1248) With:**

```markdown
**11. MANDATORY FORUM SELECTION, BINDING ARBITRATION ELECTION, AND CONSENT TO JURISDICTION**

a) **CONTRACT FORMATION AND ACCEPTANCE:**
   
   i) **This License as Binding Contract**:
       This license constitutes a binding contract between the Rights Holder and any person or entity that uses the Work. Contract formation occurs through offer and acceptance:
       
       (1) **Offer**: Rights Holder offers access to Work subject to these terms
       (2) **Acceptance**: User accepts by any of the following acts:
           - Downloading, copying, or accessing the Work
           - Using, displaying, or performing the Work
           - Creating derivative works based on the Work
           - Distributing or sharing the Work
           - Clicking "I Accept" or similar affirmative acceptance (where implemented)
           - Executing written licensing agreement incorporating these terms
       (3) **Consideration**: User receives value (access to Work); Rights Holder receives compliance with license terms and benefit-sharing
       (4) **Mutual Assent**: User's use constitutes assent to all terms herein
   
   ii) **Conspicuous Notice**:
       This license is conspicuously displayed:
       (1) At canonical URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nbiish/license-for-all-works/refs/heads/main/working-LICENSE
       (2) In LICENSE file accompanying Work
       (3) In metadata or header information of digital files
       (4) Via TK Labels indicating cultural protocols
       (5) Users have reasonable opportunity to review before accessing Work
   
   iii) **No Access Without Agreement**:
       There is no authorized access to the Work without accepting these terms. Any access without acceptance is unauthorized and violates:
       (1) This license (breach of contract)
       (2) Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030)
       (3) Applicable trespass to chattels or conversion laws

b) **MANDATORY FORUM SELECTION - TRIBAL COURT PRIMACY:**
   
   i) **Irrevocable Consent to Tribal Court Jurisdiction**:
       By accepting this license, users **irrevocably, unconditionally, and expressly consent** to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribal courts of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians ("GTBOCI Tribal Courts") over all disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to:
       
       (1) This license or its interpretation, performance, or breach
       (2) The Work or any use thereof
       (3) Traditional Knowledge or Traditional Cultural Expressions protected herein
       (4) Rights Holder's intellectual property rights
       (5) Cultural protocols, data governance, or Indigenous Data Sovereignty
       (6) Sacred sites or cultural heritage matters
       (7) Any claim seeking relief related to the subject matter of this license
   
   ii) **Exclusive Jurisdiction**:
       GTBOCI Tribal Courts have **exclusive, primary, and preferred jurisdiction**. Users agree:
       (1) NOT to initiate proceedings in any other forum absent tribal court declination
       (2) To immediately notify Rights Holder of any proceedings filed elsewhere
       (3) To cooperate in dismissing or transferring proceedings to tribal court
       (4) That tribal court decisions are final and binding (subject to tribal appellate review)
       (5) To recognize and enforce tribal court judgments

   iii) **Personal Jurisdiction Consent**:
       Users expressly submit to personal jurisdiction of GTBOCI Tribal Courts:
       (1) Consent is knowing, voluntary, and informed
       (2) Consent survives termination of license
       (3) Consent binds users, their successors, and assigns
       (4) Minimum contacts satisfied by accessing Work (purposeful availment)
       (5) Exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable under *Montana v. United States* framework
   
   iv) **Waiver of Jurisdictional Defenses**:
       Users irrevocably waive all objections to GTBOCI Tribal Court jurisdiction including:
       (1) Lack of personal jurisdiction
       (2) Improper venue
       (3) Forum non conveniens (inconvenient forum)
       (4) Insufficient minimum contacts
       (5) Tribal court lack of subject matter jurisdiction
       (6) Failure to exhaust other remedies
       
       Users acknowledge tribal court jurisdiction is proper, convenient, and reasonable.

c) **TRIBAL COURT EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENT:**
   
   i) **Mandatory Exhaustion Before Federal/State Court**:
       Under *National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe*, 471 U.S. 845 (1985), users MUST exhaust all tribal court remedies before seeking review in any other forum, including:
       (1) Filing claims in tribal trial court
       (2) Pursuing all available tribal appellate review
       (3) Obtaining final tribal court judgment
       (4) Only then may federal court review be sought (if jurisdictional grounds exist)
   
   ii) **Exhaustion Is Jurisdictional**:
       Federal courts lack jurisdiction until exhaustion complete. Premature federal filing subject to:
       (1) Motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
       (2) Abstention in favor of tribal court proceedings
       (3) Liquidated damages for improper forum per subsection (f) below
   
   iii) **Exceptions to Exhaustion** (Narrow):
       Exhaustion not required only if:
       (1) Tribal court lacks jurisdiction under tribal law (user bears burden to prove)
       (2) Exhaustion would be futile (extraordinary circumstances)
       (3) Tribal court cannot provide adequate remedy (user bears burden)
       (4) Federal statute explicitly provides for direct federal jurisdiction
       
       User asserting exception must prove by clear and convincing evidence.

d) **BACKUP FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION:**
   
   If, and only if, GTBOCI Tribal Courts decline jurisdiction or exhaustion is complete:
   
   i) **Federal Question Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331)**:
       Federal district courts have backup jurisdiction based on federal questions:
       (1) Federal Indian law (treaties, statutes, trust responsibility)
       (2) Indian Arts and Crafts Act (25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.)
       (3) Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030)
       (4) Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836)

       (6) Other federal statutes incorporated herein
   
   ii) **Federal Court Location**:
       (1) **Preferred venue**: U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan (Grand Rapids or Traverse City divisions) - nearest federal court to GTBOCI reservation
       (2) **Alternative venue**: U.S. District Court where defendant resides or where substantial part of events occurred
       (3) **Venue transfer**: If filed elsewhere, parties consent to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) transfer to Western District of Michigan
   
   iii) **Federal Court Deference to Tribal Law**:
       Federal courts adjudicating license disputes shall:
       (1) Apply federal Indian law and tribal law as primary governing law
       (2) Defer to tribal court interpretations of tribal law
       (3) Construe ambiguities in favor of tribal sovereignty (Indian canons)
       (4) Recognize tribal court judgments under principles of comity
       (5) Respect cultural protocols and Indigenous Data Sovereignty

e) **PROHIBITION ON STATE COURT JURISDICTION:**
   
   i) **No State Court Authority**:
       State courts have NO jurisdiction over disputes under this license. Users agree:
       (1) State court jurisdiction would violate tribal sovereignty
       (2) State law is preempted by federal Indian law (per *Worcester v. Georgia*)
       (3) Any state court filing is unauthorized and void
       (4) State courts must abstain or dismiss under comity principles
   
   ii) **Removal to Federal Court**:
       If defendant improperly files in state court:
       (1) Rights Holder shall remove to federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441
       (2) Federal court shall then transfer or remand to tribal court
       (3) Defendant pays all costs of removal and transfer
       (4) Liquidated damages apply per subsection (f)
   
   iii) **State Court Duty to Recognize Tribal Jurisdiction**:
       State courts encountering license disputes shall:
       (1) Recognize exclusive tribal court jurisdiction
       (2) Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
       (3) Refuse to exercise jurisdiction under comity principles
       (4) Enforce tribal court judgments under full faith and credit

f) **LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR JURISDICTIONAL BREACH:**
   
   i) **Breach Defined**:
       Jurisdictional breach occurs when user:
       (1) Files claims in non-tribal court without exhausting tribal remedies
       (2) Files in state court in violation of subsection (e)
       (3) Refuses to consent to tribal court jurisdiction
       (4) Collaterally attacks tribal court jurisdiction in another forum
       (5) Seeks anti-suit injunction against tribal court proceedings
       (6) Otherwise attempts to circumvent mandatory forum selection
   
   ii) **Liquidated Damages Calculation**:
       Upon jurisdictional breach, user immediately owes liquidated damages of:
       
       **Base Amount:**
       - Individual violators: $25,000
       - Small entities (< 100 employees): $50,000
       - Medium entities (100-1000 employees): $100,000
       - Large entities (> 1000 employees): $250,000
       - Government entities: $500,000
       
       **Plus Additional Costs:**
       - Actual attorney fees incurred responding to improper filing
       - Tribal court costs for protective orders
       - Federal court removal costs (if applicable)
       - Costs of litigating jurisdictional issues
       - Expert witness fees for federal Indian law testimony
       
       **Cultural Harm Enhancement:**
       - Add 50% if dispute involves sacred sites or ceremonial TK
       - Add 100% for willful circumvention after notice
   
   iii) **Liquidated Damages Rationale**:
       These amounts represent genuine pre-estimate of actual damages from jurisdictional breach:
       
       (1) **Difficult to Estimate**: Harm to tribal sovereignty from improper forum cannot be precisely calculated at contract formation
       
       (2) **Reasonable Forecast**:
           - Average cost of litigating jurisdiction: $50,000-$200,000
           - Delay in obtaining relief: 1-2 years, present value of delay
           - Harm to tribal sovereignty: precedent encouraging others to circumvent tribal courts
           - Cultural harm: disrespect for Indigenous legal systems
           - Federal Indian law expertise required: $500-$1000/hour for specialists
       
       (3) **Not a Penalty**: Amount proportionate to probable loss, not designed solely to deter
       
       (4) **Graduated by Violator Size**: Larger entities have greater resources and cause greater harm through well-funded jurisdictional challenges
   
   iv) **Collection and Allocation**:
       Liquidated damages:
       (1) Immediately due and payable upon breach
       (2) May be enforced in tribal court, federal court, or arbitration
       (3) Payable directly to Legacy Beneficiary per Section 9A.8/10.3
       (4) In addition to other remedies (not exclusive)
       (5) User remains liable for underlying claims after paying liquidated damages

g) **INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION OPTION:**
   
   For international users or disputes involving multiple jurisdictions, Rights Holder may elect binding arbitration:
   
   i) **Election by Rights Holder**:
       Rights Holder has sole discretion to require arbitration instead of litigation for:
       (1) International parties outside tribal court reach
       (2) Disputes requiring enforcement in multiple countries
       (3) Cases where arbitration more efficient than litigation
   
   ii) **Arbitration Framework**:
       If elected, arbitration proceeds under terms specified in Section 12.3 (as amended per International Treaties document), including:
       (1) UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
       (2) Geneva, Switzerland seat (or other agreed location)
       (3) Three arbitrators with Indigenous rights expertise
       (4) Federal Indian law and international Indigenous rights law govern
       (5) Awards enforceable under New York Convention in 172 countries
   
   iii) **Arbitration Does Not Waive Tribal Sovereignty**:
       (1) Tribal government not party to arbitration
       (2) Arbitrators apply tribal law and cultural protocols
       (3) Tribal court retains jurisdiction over matters arbitrators decline
       (4) Arbitration supplements, not replaces, tribal court option

h) **CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS:**
   
   i) **Service Methods**:
       Users consent to service of process in tribal court proceedings by:
       (1) Personal service at user's residence or principal place of business
       (2) Certified mail, return receipt requested
       (3) Email to user's designated contact or last known email
       (4) Service via registered agent if user has one
       (5) Publication if other methods unsuccessful (as last resort)
   
   ii) **Designated Agent for Service**:
       Users with business entities shall designate registered agent for service:
       (1) Agent must have address in Michigan or on GTBOCI reservation
       (2) Agent designation remains effective for 3 years after last use of Work
       (3) Designation filed with GTBOCI Tribal Court Clerk
       (4) Failure to designate allows alternative service methods above

i) **GOVERNING LAW:**
   
   This license and all disputes hereunder governed by law in following hierarchical order:
   
   i) **Primary Law**: Tribal law of Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians
   ii) **Secondary Law**: Federal Indian law including treaties, statutes, regulations, case law
   iii) **Tertiary Law**: International Indigenous rights instruments (UNDRIP, WIPO Treaty, etc.)
   iv) **Gap-Filling Law**: General principles of intellectual property and contract law, construed consistently with Indigenous rights
   
   State law does NOT apply except where explicitly incorporated and not preempted.

j) **SEVERABILITY OF FORUM SELECTION:**
   
   If any provision of this forum selection section found unenforceable:
   i) Remaining provisions remain in full force
   ii) Unenforceable provision reformed to maximum enforceable extent
   iii) Tribal court jurisdiction presumed if any ambiguity
   iv) Federal court jurisdiction as backup if tribal court unavailable
   v) NO provision permits state court jurisdiction
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Creates clear contract formation mechanism (offer, acceptance, consideration)
- Provides conspicuous notice meeting *Carnival Cruise* standard
- Irrevocable consent to jurisdiction addresses personal jurisdiction challenges
- Exhaustion requirement follows *National Farmers Union*
- Graduated liquidated damages with supporting calculation addresses penalty concerns
- Clear prohibition on state court jurisdiction
- Backup federal court jurisdiction with specific venue
- International arbitration option for cross-border enforcement

### Amendment 3: Federal Question Jurisdiction Pleading (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Insert After Section 11 (as amended), Add New Section 11A:**

```markdown
**11A. FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION AND REMOVAL PROCEDURES**

a) **FEDERAL QUESTIONS PRESENTED:**
   
   Disputes arising under this license necessarily present federal questions conferring original federal court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331:

       (5) Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125) - false advertising, cultural appropriation as deceptive practice
   
   iii) **Constitutional Questions**:
       (1) Supremacy Clause (Art. VI, cl. 2) - federal Indian law preempts state law
       (2) Commerce Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 3) - Congress's plenary power over Indian affairs
       (3) Treaty Clause (Art. II, § 2, cl. 2) - treaty protections for Indigenous rights
   
   iv) **International Law Questions** (enforceable as federal law):
       (1) WIPO Treaty on Traditional Knowledge (contractually incorporated)
       (2) UNDRIP as interpretive principle for federal Indian law
       (3) American Declaration on Indigenous Peoples' Rights (OAS member commitment)

b) **WELL-PLEADED COMPLAINT RULE:**
   
   Federal question jurisdiction exists if plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint raises federal issues:
   
   i) Claims under this license necessarily involve:
       (1) Violation of federal Indian law principles
       (2) Breach of federally-protected treaty rights
       (3) Violations of federal statutes incorporated herein
       (4) Interpretation of federal law (Indian canons of construction)
   
   ii) Federal question "arises under" federal law per *Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg.*, 545 U.S. 308 (2005):
       (1) Federal issue is necessarily raised
       (2) Federal issue is actually disputed
       (3) Federal issue is substantial
       (4) Federal jurisdiction does not disturb federal-state balance
   
   iii) Even if styled as contract claim, federal law necessarily governs contract interpretation

c) **REMOVAL TO FEDERAL COURT (28 U.S.C. § 1441):**
   
   If defendant improperly files in state court, Rights Holder SHALL remove to federal court:
   
   i) **Removal Procedure**:
       (1) Within 30 days of service, file Notice of Removal in federal court
       (2) Attach state court documents
       (3) Serve Notice on all parties and state court
       (4) State court proceedings automatically stayed
   
   ii) **Grounds for Removal**:
       (1) Federal question jurisdiction (§ 1441(a)) - based on federal questions above
       (2) Tribal sovereignty implicates federal interests
       (3) State court lacks jurisdiction over Indian affairs (*Williams v. Lee*)
       (4) Federal forum necessary to protect federal interests
   
   iii) **Venue After Removal**:
       (1) Case removed to federal district court where state court located
       (2) Rights Holder may then move to transfer to preferred venue (W.D. Mich.) under § 1404(a)
       (3) Federal court may remand to tribal court if appropriate
   
   iv) **Defendant Pays Removal Costs**:
       All costs of removal (filing fees, attorney fees, copying) borne by defendant who improperly filed in state court, plus liquidated damages per Section 11(f)

d) **REMAND/TRANSFER TO TRIBAL COURT:**
   
   After removal to federal court, appropriate disposition is remand/transfer to tribal court:
   
   i) **Motion for Remand to Tribal Court**:
       Rights Holder shall move federal court to:
       (1) Recognize exclusive tribal court jurisdiction
       (2) Remand case to tribal court under abstention/comity principles
       (3) Stay federal proceedings pending tribal court exhaustion
       (4) Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (tribal court exclusive)
   
   ii) **Federal Court Abstention Doctrines**:
       (1) *National Farmers Union* exhaustion - defer to tribal courts first
       (2) Comity - respect for tribal sovereignty counsels federal court abstention
       (3) Primary jurisdiction - tribal court better suited to resolve cultural/sovereignty issues
   
   iii) **Federal Court as Enforcement Forum Only**:
       Federal court role limited to:
       (1) Enforcing tribal court judgments
       (2) Providing injunctive relief if tribal court unavailable
       (3) Resolving federal questions tribal court declines
       (4) Generally should abstain in favor of tribal forum

e) **NO DIVERSITY JURISDICTION:**
   
   Diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 does NOT apply:
   
   i) Tribal members are citizens of their tribes, NOT states (for diversity purposes)
   ii) Complete diversity may not exist if Rights Holder is tribal citizen
   iii) Citizenship issues complex for Indigenous persons
   iv) Federal question jurisdiction is proper basis, not diversity

f) **SUPPLEMENTAL JURISDICTION:**
   
   If federal court retains jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1367) extends to:
   i) Tribal law claims forming part of same case or controversy
   ii) Cultural protocol violations related to federal claims
   iii) Traditional Knowledge misappropriation as supplemental to federal claims
   iv) All claims arising from common nucleus of operative facts

g) **APPELLATE REVIEW:**
   
   i) **Tribal Court Appeals**:
       (1) Exhaust tribal appellate review before seeking federal review
       (2) GTBOCI appellate procedures govern
       (3) Federal review limited to jurisdictional issues
   
   ii) **Federal Court Appeals**:
       (1) To U.S. Court of Appeals for Sixth Circuit
       (2) May seek certiorari to U.S. Supreme Court
       (3) Indian law specialists may file amicus briefs
```

**Legal Rationale:**
- Establishes multiple federal question bases for jurisdiction
- Provides removal procedures if defendant files in wrong court
- Creates pathway from federal court back to tribal court
- Clarifies citizenship issues for diversity jurisdiction
- Provides appellate roadmap
- Ensures federal forum available if tribal court unavailable

## VI. Conclusion

The license's **sovereign immunity and jurisdictional provisions have critical gaps** that could expose tribal government to liability or result in enforcement in wrong forums. The recommended amendments:

1. **Clearly separate individual from tribal capacity** - Prevents inadvertent tribal involvement
2. **Explicitly preserve sovereign immunity** - Multiple safeguards against C & L Enterprises waiver
3. **Create enforceable forum selection** - Clear contract formation and consent mechanisms
4. **Establish federal question jurisdiction** - Backup federal forum if tribal court unavailable
5. **Provide removal procedures** - Practical pathway out of state court
6. **Recalibrate liquidated damages** - Defensible amounts with supporting calculations

**Risk Reduction:** Implementing these amendments reduces sovereign immunity and jurisdictional vulnerabilities from **HIGH** to **LOW**, creating multiple layers of protection for tribal sovereignty while ensuring enforceable forum selection.

**Critical Success Factor:** Tribal court infrastructure must be functional for forum selection to be meaningful. Coordinate with GTBOCI judicial branch to ensure capacity for IP disputes.
