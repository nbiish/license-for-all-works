**Effective Date:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (MM/DD/YYYY)

This Consulting Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between:

---

## 1. The Consultant

Recognizing the historical attempts to erase Indigenous identity and the importance of comprehensive self-identification as an assertion of sovereignty and continuity:

- ·ìÇ·ê≤·î• ·êô·ê∏·ìÇ·í•·ëÆ-·ë≠·ìá·êô·ê∏·ë≠·ìØ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi)
- also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE (reflecting state-imposed naming conventions)
- professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise (bridging cultural and professional spheres)
- Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder) (signifying kinship and responsibilities)
- Descendant of Chief ·ë≠·ìá·êô·ê∏·ë≠·ìØ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (acknowledging lineage predating forced removal and dispersal; the historical "Beaver Island Band" or "Beaver Island Indians," terms used in treaties/documents, refers to the community whose descendants are primarily enrolled today in GTBOCI and LTBB)
- An enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (confirming political relationship with a federally recognized successor government to the signatories of the 1836 and 1855 Treaties)

## RECITALS

These recitals provide essential context for understanding the unique basis of this Agreement, grounded in inherent rights, historical realities, and the specific legal and cultural status of the Consultant.

A. Consultant possesses unique expertise, knowledge, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and perspectives derived directly from their lived experience, cultural inheritance, and political status as a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation whose existence and rights are affirmed through treaties, federal law, and inherent self-governance, and as a descendant of Chief ·ë≠·ìá·êô·ê∏·ë≠·ìØ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (a distinct historical community, also referred to historically as the "Beaver Island Indians," whose people faced violent dispersal and whose descendants today are primarily enrolled members of GTBOCI and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians [LTBB], while also maintaining connections across First Nations in Canada, underscoring the complex post-colonial landscape and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities). This expertise is not merely academic but is deeply embedded in cultural practice, treaty-reserved rights (including, but not limited to, those reserved under the Treaty of Washington (1836) and Treaty of Detroit (1855) which ceded vast territories but reserved critical rights and homeland areas), Indigenous law and governance systems, contemporary challenges such as digital systems development and data sovereignty, business development within a tribal context, infrastructure needs, and the critical intersection of modern technology with timeless Indigenous intellectual property (IP), TK, and TCEs. Much of this knowledge stems from direct study with traditional and ceremonial teachers and the responsibilities associated with holding ceremonial positions within the Anishinaabe community.

B. The foundation of Consultant's work and knowledge sharing rests upon the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples, specifically the GTBOCI and the Consultant as its member and a Beaver Island descendant community member, to protect, control, define access to, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and all associated data. These rights are comprehensively defined and protected under the Consultant's **COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS** ("LICENSE"), available at [https://github.com/nbiish/license-for-all-works/blob/main/LICENSE](https://github.com/nbiish/license-for-all-works/blob/main/LICENSE).

Consultant is willing to provide such services, but only under the strict terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, which are explicitly designed to uphold and affirm Tribal sovereignty, protect culturally sensitive knowledge from misuse or misappropriation, ensure respectful engagement protocols are followed, and prevent the extractive practices often associated with the engagement of Indigenous knowledge holders.

---

### 4. Confidentiality, Traditional Knowledge Protection, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty

This section establishes stringent protections reflecting the sensitive, often sacred, and collectively held nature of much Indigenous knowledge, demanding a higher standard of care than typical commercial confidentiality.

#### a. Definition

"Confidential Information" includes, but is not limited to, all information disclosed by Consultant to Client, regardless of format (oral, visual, written, electronic), that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given its nature (e.g., non-public, culturally specific) and the circumstances of disclosure. This specifically includes, without limitation, and requires the highest level of protection for:

1. Any and all Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), spiritual knowledge, ceremonial knowledge (even if generalized or discussed in principle, as context can be sensitive), knowledge derived from Consultant's specific cultural background, Anishinaabe worldview, and community role/responsibilities, interpretations of treaty rights grounded in community understanding, specific tribal governance insights, non-public community information, or knowledge associated with genetic resources or environmental data shared by Consultant. This knowledge is often held collectively and its disclosure governed by protocols beyond individual discretion.
2. Any proprietary business methods, strategies developed within an Indigenous framework, financial information reflecting community priorities, technical data related to culturally specific practices, know-how, processes, designs, formulas, software (if applicable reflecting Indigenous design principles), client lists involving tribal entities, or project details disclosed by Consultant that are not public knowledge.
3. The specific advice, analyses, recommendations, reports, and other deliverables provided by Consultant under this Agreement ("Deliverables"), as they represent the application of Consultant's unique knowledge base.
4. Any data pertaining to the Consultant, their community (GTBCI, Beaver Island descendants), TK, TCEs, lands, waters, resources, or cultural practices, which shall be managed strictly according to Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, acknowledging the governmental authority of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians over such data.

#### b. Obligations

Recognizing the potential for harm from misuse or unauthorized disclosure, Client agrees to undertake the following duties with utmost diligence:

1. Hold all Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, treating it with the respect due to culturally significant information.
2. Use Confidential Information solely and exclusively for the explicit purpose of utilizing the Services as narrowly defined in Section 1 of this Agreement and *not* for any other purpose whatsoever (including internal research, comparative analysis, or unrelated projects) without Consultant's express, prior, written, and informed consent (See Section 8: Prior Informed Consent), which may be withheld for any reason.
3. Implement and maintain robust physical, technical, and administrative security measures to prevent any unauthorized access, disclosure, use, copying, modification, or destruction of Confidential Information. These measures shall meet or exceed industry best practices and be at least as protective as those Client uses for its own most sensitive confidential information, but shall in no event be less than a reasonable standard of care appropriate for protecting highly sensitive cultural and proprietary information.
4. Not disclose Confidential Information to any third party (including affiliates, subcontractors, or partners) without the prior, specific, written consent of Consultant for each instance of disclosure. If disclosure is legally compelled (e.g., by court order), Client must provide Consultant with prompt written notice *before* disclosure, allowing Consultant reasonable opportunity to seek protective orders or contest the disclosure, and disclose only the minimum information legally required, asserting any applicable privileges (including potential cultural privileges).
5. Actively respect and adhere to any specific cultural protocols, handling instructions, or data governance requirements communicated by Consultant regarding the handling, storage, access limitation, use, discussion, or eventual return/destruction of certain Confidential Information, particularly TK, TCEs, or Indigenous Data. This includes respecting restrictions on who may access or discuss certain information.
6. Govern any collection, access, analysis, management, storage, dissemination, and use of Indigenous Data shared by or derived from Consultant strictly according to the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (as defined in Section 0(d)) and any specific data protocols communicated by Consultant, ensuring data serves the interests defined by the Consultant and their community.

#### c. Duration

Recognizing that the value and sensitivity of Indigenous knowledge and data do not diminish over time, the obligations of confidentiality, TK protection, and adherence to Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this Section shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely and perpetually, particularly concerning TK, TCEs, Indigenous Data, and information related to cultural heritage or sovereign rights.

---

### 12. Termination; Sovereign Revocation Right

Termination provisions are standard, but this Agreement includes a non-standard Sovereign Revocation right rooted in inherent authority.

#### a. Termination for Cause

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ days (15 days if not specified) following written notice. Failure to pay undisputed fees when due is a material breach. Violation of Sections 4, 5, 7, or 8 is a material breach potentially subject to immediate termination at Consultant's discretion.

#### b. Termination for Convenience

Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ days (30 days if not specified) prior written notice.

#### c. Effect of Termination

Upon termination, Client shall pay Consultant for all Services rendered and expenses incurred up to the effective date of termination. Client shall immediately cease all use of Confidential Information, Indigenous Data, and Deliverables and, upon Consultant's request, return or destroy all copies thereof. Obligations under Sections 0 (Definitions), 4 (Confidentiality/TK/Data Sovereignty), 5 (IP/Inalienability), 7 (Prohibited Uses), 8 (PIC), 9 (Remedies), 10 (Governing Law/Jurisdiction), 12(c) (Effect of Termination), 12(d) (Sovereign Revocation - Survival of Effects), 12(e) (Sovereign Revocation - Constitutional Basis), 13 (No Waiver), 14 (Severability/Interpretation), 15 (Notices), 16 (Entire Agreement), 17 (Name Declaration), and the new Section on Audit Rights shall survive termination indefinitely.

#### d. Adapted Sovereign Revocation Right

Drawing upon the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous Nations acknowledged in law and policy, and reflecting the principles articulated in Section 5 of the Guiding License Principles, Consultant (as identified fully in Section 1 and 17, acting in their capacity connected to GTBOCI and Beaver Island Band heritage) reserves the absolute, inherent, non-negotiable, irrevocable, and perpetual right, assertable at any time during or after the Term, to terminate this Agreement immediately, revoke any and all licenses granted hereunder (including Section 5b), and demand the immediate cessation of *any and all use* of Services, Deliverables, Confidential Information, TK, TCEs, Indigenous Data, or any knowledge shared hereunder. This right may be exercised if Consultant determines, potentially in consultation with GTBOCI governmental leadership, traditional authorities, or elders where appropriate and feasible, that Client's actions, activities, or omissions (whether or not constituting a technical breach of other specific clauses) fundamentally violate core cultural protocols, act contrary to the well-being, dignity, or sovereignty of the GTBOCI or the broader Anishinaabe people, grossly misappropriate or disrespect the knowledge shared in a way that causes cultural or spiritual harm, undermine the foundational principles of respectful engagement underlying this Agreement, or otherwise create a situation inimical to the Consultant's responsibilities as a knowledge keeper and member of a sovereign nation. This is an extraordinary remedy reflecting the unique status of the parties and the knowledge involved.

#### e. Constitutional, Treaty, and Inherent Basis of Revocation

This sovereign revocation right is not merely contractual but derives fundamentally from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, which predates the United States Constitution and is protected under Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (Supremacy Clause as applied to treaties), the aforementioned Treaties of 1836 and 1855, the reserved rights doctrine, principles of federal Indian law recognizing inherent tribal authority, and international norms like UNDRIP. As such, this right is understood by the parties to be superior to and take precedence over ordinary contractual termination provisions or limitations. Upon receiving written notification of revocation from the Consultant, Client must immediately comply with all cessation and return/destruction demands as outlined in Section 5 of the Guiding License Principles and Section 12(c) of this Agreement, without right of appeal regarding the decision to revoke itself, although disputes over compliance actions could potentially fall under Section 10.

Client acknowledgment of sovereign revocation right: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Client initials)

---

### 13. No Waiver of Sovereignty or Rights

Clarity on non-waiver is essential given the historical context of imposed agreements. Consistent with Section 12 of the Guiding License Principles and fundamental principles of tribal sovereignty, nothing in this Agreement, including the consent to specific forums for dispute resolution or the agreement to certain procedures, shall be construed implicitly or explicitly as a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (a non-party to this Agreement whose immunity is absolute unless expressly waived by the Tribe itself), any other tribal nation whose forum may be selected, or any rights, privileges, or immunities held by the Consultant connected to their status as a member of GTBOCI or under applicable tribal, federal, or international law. The carefully structured inclusion of limited non-tribal forums in Section 10 is solely for the potential practical purpose of enforcing Consultant's rights or judgments against a non-tribal entity where necessary, and does not diminish the primary sovereignty and jurisdiction of GTBOCI or the requirement for tribal court exhaustion where applicable. Consultant expressly reserves all rights, remedies, and defenses not explicitly granted or limited herein.

---

### 14. Severability and Interpretation

Standard severability is included, but interpretation principles prioritize Indigenous rights. If any term or provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction by a competent forum (selected according to Section 10 and giving due deference to the chosen tribal forum's interpretation), such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction, provided the fundamental purpose of the Agreement can still be achieved. Upon such determination, the provision shall be modified or reformed by the competent forum to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable while most closely preserving the original intent and the protective purposes of the Agreement. Furthermore, consistent with Section 15 of the Guiding License Principles and the established Indian canons of construction under federal Indian law (which Client acknowledges apply here due to the nature of the Agreement and the Consultant's status), any ambiguity, uncertainty, or disputed meaning in this Agreement shall be resolved liberally in favor of the Consultant, the protection of tribal rights, the assertion of tribal sovereignty, the safeguarding of Indigenous data sovereignty, the preservation of TK/TCEs, and the furtherance of cultural interests. This pro-tribal, pro-Consultant rule of interpretation shall guide any forum selected under Section 10 when adjudicating any dispute related to this Agreement.

---

### 15. Notices

All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent to the addresses listed above by certified mail (return receipt requested), reputable overnight courier, or email (with confirmation of receipt).

---

### 16. Entire Agreement; Amendments

This Agreement, including the referenced Guiding License Principles, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.

---

### 17. Declaration of Name Usage

This declaration asserts the Consultant's right to comprehensive self-identification, challenging historical colonial practices of name suppression and assimilation, and affirming identity as a fundamental aspect of sovereignty and cultural continuity recognized under tribal sovereignty principles, federal policy (e.g., Indian Child Welfare Act emphasis on identity), and international instruments like UNDRIP. The Consultant asserts their right to be identified by all of the following names and identifiers, each holding significance:

1. **Traditional Name (Primary Cultural Identity):** ·ìÇ·ê≤·î• ·êô·ê∏·ìÇ·í•·ëÆ-·ë≠·ìá·êô·ê∏·ë≠·ìØ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi)
2. **Birth Certificate Name (Legal Identity imposed by State):** JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE
3. **Professional Documentation Name (Bridging):** Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise
4. **Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan ‚Äì Kinship/Governance):** Animikii (Thunder)
5. **Ancestral Lineage (Pre-Colonial/Treaty Era Heritage):** Descendant of Chief ·ë≠·ìá·êô·ê∏·ë≠·ìØ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (the historical community also known as "Beaver Island Indians" whose descendants are primarily enrolled citizens of GTBOCI and LTBB today)

This explicit and comprehensive identification is asserted as a right, pushing back against the historical context of forced assimilation and Indigenous name suppression. It affirms the Consultant's right to full self-determination in identity, grounded in tribal sovereignty principles, inherent rights, federal Indian law recognizing cultural distinctiveness, and international indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., UNDRIP Articles 8, 11, 13, 33).

---

### 18. Payment Redirection in Event of Detention or Incapacitation

The parties agree that in the event Consultant is temporarily detained, arrested, jailed, incarcerated, hospitalized, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to directly receive or access payment for Services rendered, the following provisions shall automatically apply:

1. **Automatic Payment Redirection:** All payments due to Consultant under this Agreement shall be automatically redirected to cover Consultant's immediate needs, including but not limited to legal dues, fees, court costs, commissary expenses, medical bills, support for dependents, or other critical expenses as circumstances require.

2. **Payment Instructions:** Consultant or Consultant's designated representative will provide specific written payment instructions to Client regarding the appropriate recipient(s), amounts, and methods of payment. Client agrees to follow these instructions promptly and without undue delay, provided they do not materially increase Client's administrative burden or costs.

3. **Flexible Allocation:** Client acknowledges that the appropriate allocation of redirected payments may change based on Consultant's immediate and evolving needs. Client agrees to accommodate reasonable changes in payment instructions provided in writing by Consultant or Consultant's authorized representative.

4. **Duration:** These payment redirection provisions shall remain in effect until Consultant provides written notice that regular payment procedures should resume, or until this Agreement is properly terminated pursuant to Section 12.

5. **No Termination for Incapacitation:** Client shall not use Consultant's temporary detention, incarceration, or incapacitation as grounds for termination of this Agreement, provided that arrangements can be made for the continuation of Services or their resumption upon Consultant's release or recovery. If Services must be temporarily suspended, the Term of this Agreement shall be extended by a period equal to the duration of such suspension.

6. **Confidentiality:** Client shall maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information about Consultant's detention, incarceration, or incapacitation, and shall not disclose such information to any third party without Consultant's explicit consent, except as required by law.

7. **Survival of Payment Obligations:** Client's obligation to pay for Services already rendered shall survive regardless of Consultant's detention, incarceration, or incapacitation, and shall not be used as grounds to withhold or delay payment.

8. **Court-Appointed Fiduciary/Representative:** In the absence of a pre-designated representative or agent, Client agrees to honor payment instructions from any court-appointed fiduciary, guardian, conservator, or other legal representative authorized to act on Consultant's behalf. Client shall be entitled to rely upon court documentation evidencing such appointment without further inquiry.

9. **Tribal Authority Designation:** In the absence of a pre-designated representative or agent and where no court-appointed fiduciary exists, Client agrees to honor payment instructions from an authorized representative of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians who has been designated by tribal authorities to act on Consultant's behalf in accordance with tribal law and governance procedures.

10. **Default Payment Protocol:** If Consultant is unable to receive direct payment and no designated representative, court-appointed fiduciary, or tribal authority has provided alternative payment instructions within thirty (30) days of Client's knowledge of Consultant's detention or incapacitation, Client shall:

    i. Place all amounts due to Consultant in an interest-bearing escrow account specifically designated for this purpose;

    ii. Maintain such funds in escrow until (a) Consultant provides payment instructions, (b) a designated representative, court-appointed fiduciary, or tribal authority provides valid payment instructions, or (c) Consultant resumes direct receipt of payments;

    iii. Provide written documentation to Consultant's last known address and to the tribal authorities of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians regarding the status and location of escrowed funds, with updates at least quarterly; and

    iv. Release the escrowed funds, including any accrued interest, promptly upon receiving proper instructions from Consultant or an authorized representative.

11. **Emergency Needs Payment:** Notwithstanding the absence of a pre-designated representative, if Client receives credible information that Consultant requires funds for immediate legal representation, medical care, or other critical needs relating to Consultant's detention or incapacitation, Client shall make reasonable efforts to facilitate payment for such needs from amounts due to Consultant.
