# Progress is the goal
- do not delete sections without clarification from the user
- only make enhacements based on the users prompt and do not make replacements of our progress
- we have worked a long time to get this far and it would be obscene to delete our progress
- this is a precedent setting document for protecting indigenous ip, tk, tce and legacy work
