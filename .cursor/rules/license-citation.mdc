COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS

PREAMBLE
This Work (defined below) is created, held, or stewarded by ᓂᐲᔥ Nbiish Justin Kenwabikise ᑭᓇᐙᐱᑭᓯ, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction.

This license applies to "the Work," which encompasses Indigenous creations in various forms, including but not limited to software, digital materials, cultural expressions, tangible heritage, and knowledge systems. It expressly integrates and asserts rights based upon principles from Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Protocols, federal Indian law, the laws and customs of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and international indigenous rights frameworks, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

All usage, benefit-sharing, and data governance are governed by the COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS.}
   }

   Furthermore, any project, publication, presentation, performance, exhibition, or product utilizing, referencing, or derived from this Work must visibly and respectfully acknowledge the Indigenous authorship/stewardship and tribal affiliation in all relevant contexts, recognizing the work is subject to the traditional knowledge protocols, data governance, and laws of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

2. TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE (TK) & DATA SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTION AND LABELING
   This Work embodies or contains elements of Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), or knowledge associated with genetic resources, which require special protection based on the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples and the specific protocols of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The rights holder asserts both western intellectual property rights (copyright, patent, trademark, etc., where applicable) and inherent Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, including Indigenous Data Sovereignty (the right to govern collection, ownership, access, analysis, interpretation, management, dissemination, and reuse of data pertaining to the Indigenous people or knowledge from which it has been derived). This Work is assigned the following Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, developed by Local Contexts (localcontexts.org), which signal community-specific protocols and permissions:

   TK Attribution (TK A) - Specific attribution is required.
   TK Culturally Sensitive (TK CS) - Special cultural protocols govern access, use, handling, display, or performance.
   TK Community Use Only (TK CO) - Use restricted primarily to the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community, with external use requiring specific permission.
   TK Non-Commercial (TK NC) - Use for commercial purposes is prohibited without explicit permission and benefit-sharing agreement.
   TK Verified (TK V) - Affirms the Work originates from or is recognized by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community.

   The application of these labels signifies that specific community protocols govern the use, sharing, circulation, and data management related to this Work. Users are obligated to respect these protocols. Furthermore, no rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11 (right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions and customs) and 31 (right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, associated data, and intellectual property).

3. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation recognized by the United States, the rights holder reserves and asserts the absolute, inherent, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of any and all use, reproduction, distribution, performance, display, adaptation, or creation of derivative works based on this Work by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, artificial intelligence system, or other party, at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by the rights holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to protect cultural integrity, tribal sovereignty, data sovereignty, community well-being, spiritual values, or adherence to cultural protocols.

   This sovereign right derives from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and is further protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), treaties including the Treaty of Washington (1836) and the Treaty of Detroit (1855), the reserved rights doctrine, and foundational principles of federal Indian law (e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, McGirt v. Oklahoma). These rights are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements, state laws, and standard intellectual property regimes.

   The superior legal and moral force of these treaty-protected and inherent sovereign rights means this license invokes protections that exceed standard IP laws, the revocation right cannot be diminished by standard contract principles, courts must interpret ambiguities liberally in favor of tribal interests (Indian canons of construction), and disputes must be analyzed primarily within the framework of federal Indian law, tribal law, and treaty rights.

   Upon receiving notification of revocation, all parties must immediately cease all use, permanently remove/destroy all copies and derivatives, provide written confirmation of compliance within 7 calendar days, acknowledge the superior force of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, and surrender or destroy derivative materials as directed.
