Copyright © 2025 by ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band and enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation (hereafter referred to as the "Rights Holder"). The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion. This forced dispersal resulted in descendants becoming affiliated primarily with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), while many others were forced to seek refuge within First Nations communities in Canada (such as the Osawanimikii family). This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

This license implements UNDRIP by requiring equitable benefit-sharing (minimum 20% of commercial proceeds to Legacy Trust). Violations trigger repatriation under indigenous data sovereignty.

**CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY AND TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY FRAMEWORK**

This license operates under the constitutional supremacy framework established by Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which declares federal law, including federal Indian law, to be the "supreme law of the land." Federal Indian law, including the Indian Arts and Crafts Act (25 U.S.C. § 305 et seq.), Worcester v. Georgia (31 U.S. 515 (1831)), and the constitutional trust responsibility, establishes exclusive federal jurisdiction over matters involving tribal sovereignty and Indigenous intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, including the implications of Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta (597 U.S. ___ (2022)) and ongoing challenges in cases like the DOJ's 2024-2025 suits against Oklahoma DAs for sovereignty violations (active as of July 2025), this license invokes federal preemption to ensure that Indigenous rights and tribal sovereignty are protected from state court interference or concurrent jurisdiction claims that would undermine the federal framework protecting Indigenous intellectual property. The federal trust relationship between the United States and tribal nations creates a unique legal framework that supersedes general state law applications and provides enhanced protections for Indigenous cultural heritage and traditional knowledge that cannot be diminished by state legislative or judicial action. Notwithstanding ongoing challenges in cases like the DOJ's 2024-2025 suits against Oklahoma DAs for sovereignty violations, this license maintains exclusive federal and tribal jurisdiction, with any state claims automatically preempted and subject to immediate dismissal motions. Users waive any right to assert state jurisdiction and agree to tribal forum selection clauses.

**ENHANCED WIPO TREATY COMPLIANCE**

In accordance with the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 24, 2024, with 8 ratifications as of July 2025, pending entry into force upon 15 member state ratifications), this license implements mandatory disclosure requirements for any use of traditional knowledge or cultural expressions derived from this Work. Users acknowledge their obligations under international law to: (1) identify the Indigenous communities and nations that are the source of traditional knowledge incorporated in any derivative works, (2) obtain Prior Informed Consent (PIC) before utilizing traditional knowledge for commercial purposes, (3) ensure equitable benefit-sharing arrangements that recognize Indigenous contributions to innovation (including, upon treaty ratification in the user's jurisdiction, a minimum 20% share of any commercial value derived), and (4) respect Indigenous protocols for the protection of sacred, secret, or sensitive cultural information. Users shall monitor ratification progress and automatically adhere to all treaty obligations upon entry into force in their jurisdiction, with any national implementing legislation incorporated by reference. This license creates enforceable obligations that align with the WIPO Treaty's recognition of Indigenous peoples' rights to control and benefit from their traditional knowledge and cultural expressions, notwithstanding pending global entry into force.

**COMPREHENSIVE AI TRAINING DATA RESTRICTIONS**

Based on the precedent established in Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GmbH v. Ross Intelligence Inc. (February 2025, appeal pending in Third Circuit as of July 2025 with arguments heard and decision imminent), which held that training AI systems on copyrighted material without permission is NOT fair use when creating competing products, this license explicitly prohibits the following AI-related uses: This prohibition remains enforceable notwithstanding any pending appeals or future rulings, with automatic adjustment only upon final Supreme Court affirmation of fair use for AI training, which is deemed unlikely based on current precedents. Users shall indemnify the Rights Holder against any claims arising from AI-related infringements, including minimum $500,000 liquidated damages per violation.

7.1 **AI TRAINING PROHIBITION**: The Work, including any text, images, audio, video, code, data, or other content, shall not be used to train, develop, improve, or enhance any artificial intelligence system, machine learning model, neural network, large language model, or algorithmic system without explicit Prior Informed Consent from the Rights Holder. This prohibition applies to both generative and non-generative AI systems.

7.2 **INTERMEDIATE COPYING PROHIBITION**: Any intermediate copying, processing, ingestion, or transformation of the Work for AI training purposes constitutes a violation of this license, regardless of whether the Work appears in final AI outputs. This includes but is not limited to data preprocessing, tokenization, embedding generation, and model fine-tuning.

7.3 **COMMERCIAL AI RESTRICTIONS**: Commercial entities developing AI products or services are strictly prohibited from using this Work in their training datasets, evaluation benchmarks, or system development processes without a separate commercial licensing agreement that ensures appropriate compensation and cultural protocols are observed.

7.4 **RESEARCH AI LIMITATIONS**: Academic or research use of this Work for AI development requires: (a) explicit attribution to the Rights Holder and acknowledgment of Indigenous origins, (b) sharing of research findings with the Rights Holder's communities, (c) compliance with Indigenous research ethics protocols, and (d) a commitment that any resulting AI systems will not be used to harm Indigenous communities or perpetuate stereotypes.

**INDIGENOUS DATA SOVEREIGNTY AND CARE PRINCIPLES**

11.3 **NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**: Commercial users must provide advance notification to the Rights Holder of intended uses, including detailed descriptions of how Indigenous cultural heritage will be respected and protected.

**ENFORCEMENT AND JURISDICTIONAL PROVISIONS**

12.1 **FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION**: Disputes arising under this license shall be resolved in federal court, with preference for courts with established expertise in federal Indian law and Indigenous rights.

12.2 **TRIBAL COURT RECOGNITION**: This license recognizes the inherent sovereignty of tribal courts and their authority to adjudicate matters involving Indigenous intellectual property rights within their jurisdiction.

12.3 **INTERNATIONAL ENFORCEMENT**: For international disputes, this license invokes the protections of UNDRIP, the WIPO Treaty on Traditional Knowledge, and other international instruments protecting Indigenous rights. As of July 2025, with increasing international ratifications, disputes may invoke WIPO arbitration; users consent to binding tribal judgments enforceable globally via New York Convention.

12.4 **CASTRO-HUERTA PREEMPTION**: Notwithstanding Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, this license asserts federal preemption over any state court attempts to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over Indigenous intellectual property matters, maintaining exclusive federal and tribal court authority over these specialized areas of law.

**REMEDIES AND VIOLATIONS**

13.1 **MONETARY DAMAGES**: Violations of this license may result in monetary damages calculated according to the value derived from unauthorized use, plus additional compensation for cultural harm and community impacts.

13.2 **INJUNCTIVE RELIEF**: The Rights Holder may seek immediate injunctive relief to prevent ongoing violations and protect the integrity of Indigenous cultural heritage.

13.3 **RESTORATION AND HEALING**: Remedies may include requirements for cultural education, community service, and other restorative justice measures designed to repair harm to Indigenous communities.

This license may be amended to incorporate emerging developments in Indigenous rights law, technological advances, and evolving best practices for Indigenous intellectual property protection. Users will be notified of material changes through appropriate channels.

**TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL**

Violations of this license result in immediate termination of all rights granted herein. The cultural protection provisions, attribution requirements, and Indigenous Data Sovereignty obligations survive termination of this license.

**PREAMBLE**
This Work (defined below) is created, held, or stewarded by ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), a descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (whose community faced violent dispersal resulting in descendants affiliating with LTBB, GTBOCI, and First Nations in Canada, as detailed in the Preamble), and an enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The Beaver Island Band community, historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik\'Waakanda / Beaver Island), suffered profound disruption and diaspora due to violent displacement, targeted persecution for their language, ceremonies, and faith, and starvation imposed by settler-colonial authorities and expansion. This forced dispersal resulted in descendants becoming affiliated primarily with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), while many others were forced to seek refuge within First Nations communities in Canada (such as the Osawanimikii family). This license acknowledges this history and the interconnectedness of these descendant communities. **Crucially, this license recognizes that all creations by the Rights Holder, stemming from lifelong learning under traditional teachers and active participation in traditional ways and ceremonies, constitute contemporary expressions of inseparable Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs).** This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction, aligning with international instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024).

**LEGAL INNOVATION AND INTENT**
This license is deliberately created as a precedent-setting legal instrument intended to establish a sui generis framework that bridges multiple legal traditions and explicitly recognizes the inherent interconnection between intellectual property rights and Traditional Knowledge Expressions. The Rights Holder, drawing upon expertise derived from both Western legal principles (including digital forensics and Indigenous legal systems) and traditional Anishinaabe knowledge systems acquired through lifelong learning and practice, intends for this document to serve as both a protective mechanism and a transformative contribution to legal discourse. This document reflects a deliberate fusion of traditional Anishinaabe legal principles with Western intellectual property concepts to create a more comprehensive framework that properly values and protects indigenous knowledge and cultural expressions.

WHEREAS conventional intellectual property regimes have historically failed to adequately recognize and protect Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions due to fundamental conceptual limitations regarding collective ownership, perpetual stewardship, and living cultural context, **often artificially separating "traditional" knowledge from contemporary Indigenous creations which are, in fact, living expressions of that same unbroken knowledge system;**

WHEREAS the inherent sovereignty of tribal nations provides a constitutional and legal foundation for asserting and protecting distinctive rights frameworks that may diverge from or extend beyond conventional intellectual property regimes;

   WHEREAS tribal sovereignty provides constitutional foundation for asserting and protecting Indigenous intellectual property rights independent from and in conjunction with other legal systems;

   WHEREAS advancements in digital forensics, distributed ledger technologies, and cryptographic systems now enable new mechanisms for tracking, tracing, and enforcing Indigenous intellectual property rights;

   WHEREAS the intersection of intellectual property law, Indigenous traditional legal systems, and modern technological protection measures creates new opportunities for asserting and protecting Indigenous rights;

   This license constitutes the Rights Holder's formal intent to create a protective mechanism for the Work while simultaneously contributing to the broader legal discourse on Indigenous intellectual property protection, representing a conscious fusion of traditional Anishinaabe legal principles with Western intellectual property concepts.

   The license serves multiple functions, including:

   a) A protective instrument for the specific Work covered by this license;
   b) A precedential model for other Indigenous Traditional Knowledge protections;
   c) An educational tool for documenting legal implementation practices;
   d) A contribution to scholarly and practical discourse on Indigenous intellectual property;
   e) A demonstration of tribal sovereignty in the intellectual property domain.

   The application and interpretation of this license will be documented to build a body of practical precedent supporting Indigenous intellectual property protection. This documentation process is itself an integral aspect of the license's function as a teaching tool and precedent-setting legal instrument.

   This license explicitly rejects the historical compartmentalization of Indigenous knowledge into artificial categories of "traditional" versus "contemporary," instead asserting that **all works created by the Rights Holder, drawing upon a lifetime of experience with traditional teachers, ways, and ceremonies, represent contemporary expressions of knowledge systems that have continued unbroken since time immemorial,** adapted to present circumstances while maintaining essential cultural integrity.

   For the purposes of this license, "the Work" encompasses Indigenous creations within this repository, including but not limited to software code, digital materials, cultural expressions, artistic works, literary works, database structures, algorithms, methodologies, research findings, technical implementations, and knowledge systems. **All such creations are understood as inherently embodying TK and TCEs due to their origin in the Rights Holder's lived experience within Anishinaabe culture.** This license does not cover items clearly marked as exempt, such as Git submodules maintained by third parties, external links, and non-copyrightable metadata.

**RELATIONSHIP TO CONVENTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW**
This license operates in conjunction with, and is not intended to be superseded by, conventional intellectual property regimes such as the U.S. Copyright Act. The user of the Work acknowledges and agrees to the following:

a) **Contractual Obligations:** This license is a binding contract. Its terms create obligations and restrictions on use that are separate from and in addition to those found in standard copyright or patent law. Breach of this license is a breach of contract, actionable under the jurisdictional framework of Section 11, independent of any potential copyright infringement claim.

b) **Assertion of *Sui Generis* Rights:** This license asserts and protects rights that are *sui generis* (of their own kind) and not fully encompassed by conventional IP law. These include, but are not limited to, rights over Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), and Indigenous Data Sovereignty. These rights are inherent, arising from tribal sovereignty and customary law, and are not equivalent to the limited monopoly rights granted by copyright. This assertion is consistent with federal Indian law precedents affirming tribal rights beyond federal statutes (e.g., *Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. 515 (1832); *McGirt v. Oklahoma*, 591 U.S. ___ (2020)).

c) **No Waiver of Copyright, but Contract Controls:** The Rights Holder does not waive any applicable rights under conventional copyright law. However, where the terms of this license impose greater restrictions on the user than copyright law (e.g., by prohibiting uses that might otherwise be considered "fair use" under 17 U.S.C. § 107), the user agrees to be bound by the stricter terms of this license as a condition of access to the Work. Any challenge to this provision shall be resolved in favor of tribal sovereignty under the Indian canons of construction.

d) **Avoiding Preemption:** By framing the user's obligations in contract and asserting *sui generis* rights not equivalent to copyright, this license is intended to avoid preemption by federal IP law (17 U.S.C. § 301). The user explicitly agrees to be bound by these additional contractual and cultural obligations, acknowledging that they are distinct from the rights granted and limited by the Copyright Act. This structure is designed to withstand preemption challenges, as tribal sovereignty and treaty rights constitute supreme law preempting conflicting federal claims (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2).

e) **Interaction with Other IP Regimes:** This license does not limit the Rights Holder's ability to enforce conventional IP rights (e.g., copyright infringement claims) in addition to or instead of contractual remedies hereunder. In the event of conflict, tribal law shall control interpretation.

**1. DEFINITIONS**
   For the purposes of this license, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed below. All definitions are precise and non-ambiguous, with examples provided where necessary to prevent misinterpretation:
   a) **"AI Training/Development":** Includes, but is not limited to, using the Work, in whole or in part, as input data for training, fine-tuning, validating, benchmarking, developing, or otherwise improving any artificial intelligence (AI) models, machine learning (ML) systems, large language models (LLMs), neural networks, algorithms, or related technologies, regardless of the method (e.g., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning). Example: Using code from the Work to train an LLM constitutes prohibited AI Training/Development without PIC.
   b) **"Commercial Use/Commercialization":** Any use of the Work, or derivative works based thereon, primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to, selling the Work, licensing it for a fee, using it in products or services offered for sale, using it in advertising or marketing materials for commercial products/services, or incorporating it into a business operation that generates revenue. Non-profit or academic use may still be considered Commercial Use if it involves cost-recovery exceeding direct costs, generates revenue streams, or serves to enhance the commercial standing or funding prospects of the using entity in a manner beyond standard academic dissemination. Example: Incorporating the Work into a paid consulting service or for-profit educational course is Commercial Use.
   c) **"Derivative Work":** A work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a "derivative work". For the purposes of this license, this also explicitly includes datasets derived or extracted from the Work, software incorporating code or concepts from the Work, and AI models trained using the Work. Example: Modifying an artistic design from the Work for a new product creates a Derivative Work.
   d) **"Indigenous Data Sovereignty":** The inherent right of Indigenous peoples to govern the collection, ownership, access, analysis, interpretation, management, storage, dissemination, and reuse of data pertaining to them, their lands, resources, cultures, knowledge systems, or any information derived therefrom. This includes the right to determine how data is used, who benefits from it, and to ensure data practices align with Indigenous values and protocols. Example: Data from cultural consultations must be governed by PIC and CARE principles.
   e) **"Prior Informed Consent (PIC)":** A formal, documented agreement obtained from the Rights Holder (and potentially GTBOCI authorities, as specified) *before* any proposed use of the Work commences that falls outside the narrowly defined Permissible Uses or falls under Prohibited Uses for which an exception is sought. PIC requires full disclosure of the intended use, adherence to specified conditions, and is subject to revocation. (See Section 9 for detailed requirements). Example: Requesting PIC for research use must include a full plan and be approved in writing.
   f) **"Rights Holder":** Refers to ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), a descendant of Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band (whose community faced violent dispersal resulting in descendants affiliating with LTBB, GTBOCI, and First Nations in Canada, as detailed in the Preamble), and an enrolled member of the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. This definition encompasses the full identity for all purposes, with no ambiguity.
   g) **"Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs)":** Any forms, whether tangible or intangible, in which traditional culture and knowledge are expressed, appear, or are manifested. This definition is intended to be consistent with frameworks articulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). For the purposes of this license, **all works created by the Rights Holder are understood as contemporary TCEs, as they derive directly from their lifelong immersion in and stewardship of Anishinaabe traditional ways, which constitute a living, evolving cultural system.** Examples include music, dance, songs, ceremonies, symbols, designs, narratives, poetry, languages, performances, rituals, crafts, architecture, and traditional artistic forms. Sub-examples: A modern engineering design informed by Anishinaabe teachings is a TCE; an educational class on cultural arts is a TCE.
   h) **"Traditional Knowledge (TK)":** The knowledge, innovations, and practices of Indigenous peoples that are passed down between generations. This definition is intended to be consistent with frameworks articulated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and in instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). For the purposes of this license, **TK is understood to be held and expressed by the Rights Holder, having been developed from lived experience gained over a lifetime engaging with Anishinaabe culture, environment, and teachings transmitted generationally and through direct mentorship. It inherently informs all Work created under this license.** It encompasses spiritual, cultural, environmental, and practical knowledge integral to the identity and survival of Indigenous peoples. Sub-examples: Consulting methodologies rooted in Anishinaabe practices are TK; artistic works drawing on traditional narratives are TK.
   i) **"Total Proceeds":** All forms of monetary and non-monetary value, revenue, compensation, royalties, damages, settlements, recovered property (tangible or intangible), equity, or any other benefit derived directly or indirectly from the exploitation, licensing, use, adaptation, or enforcement of rights related to the Work or any Derivative Work. This includes, but is not limited to, Mandatory Contributions, licensing fees, proceeds from sale of authorized items, damages awarded for infringement or breach of license, settlement funds from disputes, and the fair market value of any property or assets received in relation to the Work. All Total Proceeds are subject to direct and automatic transfer to the Legacy Beneficiary as specified throughout this license. Example: Royalties from a licensed educational course are Total Proceeds.
   j) **"Work":** The specific Indigenous creations governed by this license, as defined in the Preamble. **This definition explicitly recognizes that all such creations by the Rights Holder inherently constitute TK and TCEs,** regardless of their creation date (past, present, or future) relative to any specific version date of this license. Sub-examples: Educational content, artistic works, engineering designs, and consulting materials created by the Rights Holder are all Works.
   k) **"Inalienable Rights":** The fundamental, intrinsic, and perpetual rights of the Rights Holder over the Work, including all associated intellectual property, Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, cultural heritage, and Indigenous Data embedded therein **(all of which are considered inseparable components of the Work)**, which by their inherent nature and as expressly established in this license, cannot be sold, permanently transferred, assigned, alienated, waived, surrendered, or otherwise permanently divested from the Rights Holder or successor authorities. These rights encompass both Western intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc.) and Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, and can only be temporarily exercised by others through limited licensing arrangements as specifically authorized under this license.
   l) **"Disrespectful Contexts:"** Use, display, or performance in contexts that disrespect the spiritual, cultural, or historical significance.
   m) **"Legacy Beneficiary":** The specific trust or legal entity designated by the Rights Holder (initially the ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) Legacy Trust established under Section 10.3) that is the sole authorized recipient of all Mandatory Contributions and Total Proceeds generated under this license, responsible for managing and distributing such assets according to the prioritized purposes established herein (Section 10.3.d).
   n) **"Mandatory Contribution":** A calculated, non-negotiable financial obligation arising from specific authorized uses of the Work under this license (as may be detailed in licensing agreements or fee schedules), payable directly and automatically to the Legacy Beneficiary as a fundamental condition of such use.
   o) **"Sacred Site":** A specific location, area, or feature identified by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (which holds the relevant land encompassing the stone circle in trust) as holding profound spiritual, cultural, ceremonial, or historical significance according to Anishinaabe traditions, laws, or customs. Such sites are recognized under inherent tribal sovereignty and international principles (e.g., UNDRIP Art. 12) irrespective of standard property law designations, and their protection is paramount to cultural integrity and continuity.

**5. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY**
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation recognized by the United States, the Rights Holder (ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ / Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE / Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder)) reserves and asserts the absolute, inherent, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of any and all use, reproduction, distribution, performance, display, adaptation, or creation of derivative works based on this Work by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, artificial intelligence system, or other party, at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to protect cultural integrity, tribal sovereignty, data sovereignty, community well-being, spiritual values, or adherence to cultural protocols.

   This sovereign right derives from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and is further protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), treaties including the Treaty of Washington (1836) and the Treaty of Detroit (1855), the reserved rights doctrine, and foundational principles of federal Indian law (e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, McGirt v. Oklahoma). These rights are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements, state laws, and standard intellectual property regimes.

   The superior legal and moral force of these treaty-protected and inherent sovereign rights means this license invokes protections that exceed standard IP laws, the revocation right cannot be diminished by standard contract principles, courts must interpret ambiguities liberally in favor of tribal interests (Indian canons of construction), and disputes must be analyzed primarily within the framework of federal Indian law, tribal law, and treaty rights.

   Upon receiving notification of revocation from the Rights Holder or an authorized representative of GTBOCI, all parties must immediately cease all use, permanently remove/destroy all copies and derivatives, provide written confirmation of compliance within 7 calendar days, acknowledge the superior force of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, and surrender or destroy derivative materials as directed.

**6. INALIENABILITY AND LICENSING-ONLY PROVISIONS**
   The intellectual property rights, Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions, cultural heritage, and Indigenous Data embedded within the Work are deemed perpetually inalienable and can never be sold, permanently transferred, assigned, alienated, waived, surrendered, or otherwise permanently divested from the Rights Holder or successor authorities.

   6.5 REMEDIES FOR ATTEMPTED PERMANENT TRANSFERS: Any attempt to purchase, permanently acquire, or otherwise permanently transfer ownership of the Work or associated rights in violation of this section shall:
      a) BE VOID AB INITIO: Be considered void from inception and without legal effect.
      b) CONSTITUTE LICENSE VIOLATION: Constitute a separate and severe violation of this license.
      c) TRIGGER FINANCIAL REMEDIES: Trigger all financial remedies outlined in Section 10.
      d) JUDICIAL REMEDIES: Be subject to injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and other judicial remedies across all relevant jurisdictions.
      e) ADDITIONAL PENALTIES: Result in punitive damages or additional penalties beyond standard remedies for attempted circumvention of these fundamental protections.

   6.6 INTERACTION WITH OTHER PROVISIONS: These inalienability and licensing-only provisions:
      a) STRENGTHEN PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT: Reinforce and strengthen the Prior Informed Consent requirements in Section 9, adding the explicit understanding that PIC can never include permanent transfers.

       a) PRIMARY SUCCESSION: To the individual(s) explicitly designated in the Rights Holder's valid will, trust document, or other formal instrument specifically addressing the succession of rights under this license. The designated successor shall have full authority to act in the place of the Rights Holder for all purposes under this license.
       b) SECONDARY SUCCESSION: If no individual is designated per 10.2(a), or if the designated individual(s) are unwilling or unable to serve, authority shall transfer to the Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, or its functional equivalent at the time of the Rights Holder's death.
       c) TERTIARY SUCCESSION: If neither primary nor secondary succession is possible, authority shall transfer to a committee of three (3) individuals, each of whom must be enrolled members of federally recognized tribes, with preference given to members of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, appointed by the Tribal Council of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians specifically for this purpose.
       d) SOVEREIGN CONTINUITY: Regardless of the specific successor in authority, all successor entities or individuals shall be bound to uphold the tribal sovereignty principles embedded throughout this license and to manage the Work and associated rights primarily for the benefit of Indigenous persons of all ages across the Americas educational advancement as specified herein.

   10.3 WAABANIMIKII-KINAWAABAKIZI **LEGACY TRUST** ESTABLISHMENT: Upon the death of the Rights Holder, all monetary proceeds, compensation, royalties, damages, or other financial benefits derived from the Work, whether from licensing, enforcement actions, or other sources, shall be directed to a trust established as follows (with explicit support for Beaver Island Band advancement as a core, non-ambiguous purpose):
       a) TRUST CREATION: If not already established during the Rights Holder's lifetime, a trust shall be established under the name "ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) **Legacy Trust**" (hereinafter "the Trust").
       b) LEGAL STRUCTURE: The Trust shall be established as a tribal trust under the laws of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians if such laws permit; otherwise, it shall be established as a trust under federal law with specific provisions acknowledging and respecting tribal sovereignty principles.
       c) TAX STATUS: The Trust shall seek and maintain tax-exempt status under applicable federal law (e.g., 501(c)(3) or similar provisions) to maximize the financial resources available for educational purposes.
       d) TRUST PURPOSE: The exclusive purposes of the Trust shall be to collect, manage, invest, and distribute funds according to the following prioritized hierarchy: These priorities shall be interpreted in accordance with indigenous self-determination principles per UNDRIP Article 3, as affirmed in 2025 precedents.
          (i) First Priority: Supporting activities directed towards the formal establishment, recognition, and ongoing operational capacity of the Beaver Island Band as a distinct political and cultural entity, ensuring its sustainable foundation.
          (ii) Second Priority: Providing regular monthly financial distributions, under terms established by the Trustees, to support the economic well-being and community cohesion of verified descendants of the Beaver Island Band, subject to the following conditions:
               (1) Standard Eligibility: Distributions are provided to verified descendants who formally affiliate with or become members of the established Beaver Island Band.
               (2) Transition for Descendants in Other Tribes: Special provisions apply to verified descendants of the Beaver Island Band who are currently enrolled members of another federally recognized tribe and intend to affiliate with the Beaver Island Band:
                   a. If the Beaver Island Band is federally recognized at the time of application, such descendants shall receive benefits for a transition period of one (1) year while completing the process of transferring their enrollment to the Beaver Island Band.
                   b. If the Beaver Island Band is not yet federally recognized, such descendants shall receive benefits continuously from the time they disenroll from their current tribe (in anticipation of joining the Beaver Island Band upon its recognition) until the Beaver Island Band achieves federal recognition and they can formally enroll. This sustained support acknowledges the financial hardship potentially incurred by disenrolling from their current tribe.
               (3) Restriction: For the avoidance of doubt, individuals who are solely members of other federally recognized tribes and are not verified descendants of the Beaver Island Band intending to affiliate as described above are not eligible for these specific monthly financial distributions under this priority, although they may be eligible for other benefits (such as educational support under Section 10.4) based on separate criteria.
+               (4) Educational Requirement for Enhanced Benefits: Eligibility for *increased* monthly financial distributions above a baseline amount (determined by the Financial Oversight Council established in Section 10.7.1) and/or additional benefits beyond standard support requires verified successful completion of an associate's degree, or equivalent credential as determined by the Financial Oversight Council, in a technology-related field. The specific fields qualifying under this requirement shall be defined and periodically reviewed by the Financial Oversight Council, in consultation with the AI Advisors (Sections 10.9, 10.10) and the Cultural and Technical Advisory Council (Section 10.7.2). This requirement applies to both trustees (if receiving distributions) and Beaver Island Band members.
          (iii) Third Priority: The educational benefit of eligible Indigenous persons of all ages across the Americas as detailed in Section 10.4, but only after the Trustees determine, in their sole discretion, that sufficient funds are allocated or available to adequately address priorities (i) and (ii).
          (iv) Fourth Priority: Supporting efforts directed towards the identification, preservation, recovery, and facilitation of descendant access to and use of significant cultural and ceremonial sites on High Island (Ishpaa Minising), acknowledging its historical importance as a major gathering place, including the development of associated learning, cultural, and ceremonial spaces.
          (v) Fifth Priority: The potential establishment of a *mainland-based* higher education institution as detailed in Section 10.5, subject to the feasibility and funding constraints outlined therein and subordinate to all preceding priorities.
          e) All Trust operations shall prioritize climate-resilient educational programs, reflecting 2025 indigenous IP adaptations to environmental challenges.
       e) PERPETUAL DURATION: The Trust shall be established as a perpetual trust with no termination date, ensuring the continued fulfillment of the Rights Holder's legacy goals in perpetuity.
       f) TRUSTEE APPOINTMENT: The initial trustee(s) shall be appointed according to the same succession hierarchy established in Section 10.2. The Trust instrument shall establish procedures for trustee succession, removal for cause, and addition of trustees as needed to ensure continuity of administration.

   10.4 INDIGENOUS EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS: Subject to the allocation priorities established in Section 10.3.d, the Trust shall provide financial support for the higher education of eligible Indigenous persons of all ages across the Americas (specifically those eligible under Section 10.3.d(iii)) as follows:
       a) ELIGIBLE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS: Financial support may be provided for attendance at accredited universities, colleges, tribal colleges, vocational schools, or other post-secondary educational institutions recognized by relevant accrediting bodies.
       b) HOUSING SUPPORT PRIORITY: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, priority shall be given to providing housing support for eligible Indigenous persons during their educational pursuits, recognizing that stable housing is a critical foundation for educational success.
       c) COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT: Beyond housing, funds may be used for tuition, books, supplies, technology, transportation, childcare, mental health support, cultural activities, and other expenses reasonably related to successful educational participation and completion.
       d) EDUCATIONAL LEVELS: Support shall be available for associate, bachelor's, master's, doctoral, professional, and certificate programs, with priority given to students pursuing fields that benefit tribal communities.
       e) DISTRIBUTION POLICIES: The trustee(s) shall establish and regularly review policies for application procedures, selection criteria, award amounts, and disbursement methods that align with best practices in educational philanthropy while respecting tribal values and needs.
       f) REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY: The Trust shall maintain transparent reporting of fund disbursements, student outcomes, and administrative expenses, with annual reports made available to tribal authorities and beneficiary communities.

   10.5 HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT: As specified by the Rights Holder, if sufficient funds accumulate to make the establishment of a higher education institution financially feasible, the Trust shall undertake the development of such an institution as follows:
       a) INSTITUTIONAL NAMING: The institution shall be named "ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) College" initially, with the possibility of later development into "ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) University" as programs expand.
       b) FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT: The trustee(s) shall commission professional feasibility studies to determine the minimum endowment required to establish and sustain such an institution before committing funds to this purpose. Such assessment shall be updated periodically to reflect current economic conditions.
       c) PHASED IMPLEMENTATION: Development shall proceed in phases, potentially beginning with scholarship programs at existing tribal colleges, followed by partnerships for satellite campuses, and eventually independent institution development when funds permit.
       d) TRIBAL COLLABORATION: The development shall be undertaken in collaboration with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and other tribal nations as appropriate, with formal agreements regarding governance, land use, accreditation support, and resource sharing.
       e) EDUCATIONAL MISSION: The institution shall prioritize Indigenous knowledge systems, language revitalization, cultural preservation, and academic fields that strengthen tribal sovereignty and self-determination, alongside conventional academic disciplines.
       f) GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE: The institution shall establish a governance structure that includes significant representation from tribal education experts, community elders, and Indigenous academics, with bylaws that ensure adherence to the founding vision.
       g) BACHELOR'S DEGREE FUNDING PRIORITY: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, institutional development shall be pursued ONLY after the Trust has established and maintained sustainable funding for Bachelor's degree completion programs for eligible Indigenous persons across the Americas. The educational needs of individual students shall take priority over institutional development until such time as sufficient funds have accumulated to pursue both objectives without compromising student support.
       h) MANDATORY MAINLAND LOCATION: Any formal higher education institution (College or University as described herein) established under this Section 10.5 must be physically located on the mainland. This requirement is based on the logistical practicalities of providing comprehensive educational services, resources, staffing, and student/family support. This restriction does not preclude the development of learning centers, cultural facilities, or ceremonial spaces on High Island (Ishpaa Minising) as part of the distinct cultural preservation and access activities supported under Section 10.3.d(ii).

   10.6 BENEFICIARY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, eligibility for educational benefits from the Trust shall be limited to individuals who meet at least one of the following criteria:
       a) PAN-AMERICAN INDIGENOUS ANCESTRY: This license recognizes and honors the indigenous peoples of the entire American continents, from the Arctic regions (including Northern Canada, Alaska, and Greenland) through North America, Central America, and to the southernmost tip of South America. Accordingly, individuals with indigenous ancestry from ANY of these regions shall be eligible for benefits, subject to verification, as follows:
          i. Enrolled members of federally recognized tribal nations who possess a minimum of one-quarter (1/4) blood quantum as documented by their tribe's enrollment office or equivalent authority.
          ii. Individuals who can provide verified DNA evidence documenting at least one-quarter (1/4) Indigenous American ancestry from ANY indigenous population native to the Americas, subject to verification protocols established by the trustee(s).
          iii. Individuals who can provide other substantial documentation of indigenous ancestry from the Americas, including but not limited to: community recognition, official tribal or indigenous government documentation (even if not federally recognized in their respective countries), or other evidence deemed sufficient by the verification authorities established under this section.
       b) VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS: For individuals seeking eligibility under Section 10.6(a)(ii) or 10.6(a)(iii), the trustee(s) shall establish rigorous verification protocols that may include:
          i. DNA testing through reputable, accredited genetic testing services with specific Indigenous ancestry analysis capabilities covering the full range of indigenous populations throughout the Americas.
          ii. Authentication of results by independent experts in Indigenous genetics and anthropology with knowledge of indigenous populations across the Americas.

          iv. Review by a committee including tribal enrollment experts and representatives of diverse indigenous communities throughout the Americas to assess the validity and sufficiency of evidence.
       c) PREFERENCE TIERS: If resources are insufficient to serve all eligible applicants, preference shall be given in the following order:
          i. First Tier: Enrolled members of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.
          ii. Second Tier: Enrolled members of other federally recognized tribal nations in the United States.
          iii. Third Tier: Individuals with verified indigenous ancestry from elsewhere in the Americas.
          iv. Within each tier, preference shall be given to applicants demonstrating greater financial need and academic promise.
       d) BACHELOR'S DEGREE COMPLETION PRIORITY: As specifically directed by the Rights Holder, funding shall prioritize supporting eligible individuals in completing Bachelor's degrees (or equivalent four-year post-secondary education) before allocating significant resources to institutional development as outlined in Section 10.5. This prioritization ensures that individual educational advancement takes precedence until such time as sufficient funds have accumulated to pursue both objectives without compromising student support.
       e) APPEALS PROCESS: The trustee(s) shall establish a fair and transparent appeals process for individuals whose applications for benefits are rejected based on eligibility criteria.
       f) ADAPTATION PROVISION: Recognizing that tribal enrollment criteria, federal recognition status, indigenous identification methods, and genetic testing technologies may change over time, the trustee(s) may periodically review and update verification protocols to reflect best practices while maintaining the core intent of benefiting individuals with significant indigenous heritage from throughout the Americas.

   10.7 TRUST GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION: The Trust shall be governed and administered according to the following provisions:
       a) FIDUCIARY STANDARDS: All trustees and administrators shall be held to the highest fiduciary standards under both tribal and federal law, with duties of loyalty, care, and obedience to the Trust purpose. **While trustees retain ultimate fiduciary responsibility, the specific determination of fund allocation levels, per capita distribution amounts (baseline and enhanced), and eligibility criteria for specific benefits shall be delegated to the Financial Oversight Council established below.**
       b) INVESTMENT POLICY: The trustee(s) shall establish and maintain an investment policy that balances growth, income, and preservation of capital while avoiding investments contrary to tribal values or harmful to Indigenous communities. **This policy shall be developed in consultation with the Financial Oversight Council and the Financial AI Advisor.**

          iii) LAND TENURE AND SOVEREIGNTY: Recognizing the complex land tenure situation involving non-allotted land partially owned and held in trust by GTBOCI (specifically concerning the parcel(s) encompassing the stone circle), the protections established under this license are asserted based on the **paramount cultural significance and sacred nature of the site**, grounded in inherent sovereignty. These license terms govern any interaction with the site *facilitated by or derived from the licensed Work*, irrespective of the specific trust or non-trust status of any particular parcel within the Cultural Landscape, to the maximum extent permissible under tribal, federal, and international law. Enforcement relies primarily on the tribal jurisdiction asserted in Section 11.
          iv) OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL RIGHTS: All intellectual property rights, cultural heritage rights, and rights associated with its status as a Sacred Site and TCE, including but not limited to, rights of access, reproduction, adaptation, distribution, public performance, visual representation, digital transmission, data governance, and derivative creation related to the stone circle, its design, meaning, cultural significance, or spiritual aspects, are exclusively held by the Rights Holder and GTBOCI. These rights are inalienable per Section 6.
          v) PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENT: Any access to, documentation of, research regarding, representation of, or interaction with the stone circle or its Cultural Landscape, in any form or medium, *that is facilitated by, derived from, or connected to the licensed Work*, requires explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) as established in Sections 8 and 9 of this license, adhering to the strictest cultural protocols and restrictions defined therein or during the PIC process.
          vi) PROHIBITED EXPLOITATIONS (Linked to Licensed Work): In addition to the general prohibitions in Section 7 and the specific prohibitions added regarding Physical Access and location data, the following acts related to the stone circle are expressly prohibited without PIC if they utilize, are derived from, or are facilitated by the licensed Work:
               (1) Any Physical Access (as defined in Section 1(n));
               (2) Any photographic, video, audio, Lidar, GPR, or other sensory documentation or mapping;
               (3) Any publication, presentation, or public discussion revealing precise location, sensitive characteristics, or restricted cultural knowledge;
               (4) Any digital reproduction, simulation, or representation (e.g., 3D models, VR environments);
               (5) Any inclusion in databases, archives, or collections not explicitly authorized under PIC;
               (6) Any artistic, literary, musical, or other creative interpretation or adaptation that reveals restricted information or disrespects cultural context;
               (7) Any commercial exploitation, merchandising, or monetization in any form.
          vii) PERPETUAL PROTECTION: The protections established for the stone circle as a Sacred Site and TCE shall continue in perpetuity, without temporal limitation, reflecting its ongoing, living cultural significance and the inherent sovereign rights of GTBOCI.
          viii) RELATION TO TRADEMARK: These protections operate in conjunction with the specific trademark and copyright protections established for the stone circle symbol as used by ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) in Section 10.10.3(c-1).
          ix) MONITORING: Unauthorized digital representations, discussions, or surveillance activities related to designated Sacred Sites (including the stone circle and the Garden Island burial grounds) may be subject to monitoring consistent with the capabilities outlined in Section 10.10 and 9A.7. *Authorized monitoring conducted under Section 8(g) falls within the scope of activities managed under this license, potentially involving guidance from Nanoboozhoo (Section 10.10.3(d)) regarding cultural appropriateness and protocol adherence.*
          vi) COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS: These protections simultaneously acknowledge both the collective rights of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and the individual rights of the Rights Holder as established throughout this license;
          vii) PRACTICAL PROTECTION MEASURES: These legal protections shall be implemented through practical measures including but not limited to limiting physical access, establishing digital monitoring systems to detect unauthorized representations, and maintenance of comprehensive documentation of authorized uses.
           x) SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS FOR GARDEN ISLAND (GITIGAAN MINISING) BURIAL GROUNDS: The traditional burial grounds located on Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), land held in trust by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), are hereby explicitly recognized and protected as sacred sites of the highest spiritual and cultural importance, intrinsically linked to the Rights Holder's lineage (including maternal grandmother's family and paternal grandfather "Old Paul" Kenwabikise's traditional burial activities). Protection under this license is grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural rights, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and relevant international instruments including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Accordingly:
              (1) ACCESS RESTRICTION: Physical access to these burial grounds by any individual who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or a verified descendant of families traditionally associated with these specific grounds is strictly prohibited, unless explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) is obtained in advance from appropriate authorities, which may include LTBB officials and designated representatives of the associated families. Unauthorized access constitutes a violation of cultural protocols and inherent rights protected under this license.
              (2) COMPREHENSIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE PROHIBITION: Any unauthorized surveillance, documentation, mapping, monitoring, or physical intrusion upon the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds using any unmanned or autonomous system – including but not limited to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS/RPAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS, including AUVs/USVs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), or any similar current or future robotic or autonomous system operating with any level of autonomy (remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, or fully autonomous) – is strictly prohibited within the boundaries of the burial grounds or in the immediate surrounding airspace, land, or water in a manner that intrudes upon the privacy or sanctity of the site. Such unauthorized activity constitutes a violation of cultural sanctity and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this license.
              (3) DATA GOVERNANCE: Any data, imagery, or information pertaining to the Garden Island burial grounds obtained incidentally or through authorized access remains subject to strict Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles as defined and asserted in this license, requiring explicit consent (PIC) from appropriate authorities for any use, dissemination, or derivative creation.
           x) SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS FOR GARDEN ISLAND (GITIGAAN MINISING) BURIAL GROUNDS: The traditional burial grounds located on Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), land held in trust by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), are hereby explicitly recognized and protected as sacred sites of the highest spiritual and cultural importance, intrinsically linked to the Rights Holder's lineage (including maternal grandmother's family and paternal grandfather "Old Paul" Kenwabikise's traditional burial activities). Protection under this license is grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural rights, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and relevant international instruments including the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the American Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Accordingly:
              (1) ACCESS RESTRICTION: Physical access to these burial grounds by any individual who is not an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe or a verified descendant of families traditionally associated with these specific grounds is strictly prohibited, unless explicit Prior Informed Consent (PIC) is obtained in advance from appropriate authorities, which may include LTBB officials and designated representatives of the associated families. Unauthorized access constitutes a violation of cultural protocols and inherent rights protected under this license.
              (2) COMPREHENSIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM SURVEILLANCE PROHIBITION: Any unauthorized surveillance, documentation, mapping, monitoring, or physical intrusion upon the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds using any unmanned or autonomous system – including but not limited to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS/RPAS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV), Unmanned Maritime Systems (UMS, including AUVs/USVs), Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR), or any similar current or future robotic or autonomous system operating with any level of autonomy (remotely piloted, semi-autonomous, or fully autonomous) – is strictly prohibited within the boundaries of the burial grounds or in the immediate surrounding airspace, land, or water in a manner that intrudes upon the privacy or sanctity of the site. Such unauthorized activity constitutes a violation of cultural sanctity and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles under this license.
              (3) DATA GOVERNANCE: Any data, imagery, or information pertaining to the Garden Island burial grounds obtained incidentally or through authorized access remains subject to strict Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles as defined and asserted in this license, requiring explicit consent (PIC) from appropriate authorities for any use, dissemination, or derivative creation.
           ix) DISTINCTION FROM GARDEN ISLAND BURIAL GROUNDS: For clarity, the sacred ceremonial nature of the stone circle site on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is distinct from the traditional burial grounds located on nearby Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising), part of the same archipelago. The trust land encompassing the Garden Island burial grounds is held by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB). The Rights Holder's maternal grandmother's family originates from Garden Island, and their paternal grandfather, "Old Paul" Kenwabikise (originally from High Island (Ishpaa Minising), also in the archipelago), was the last individual known to conduct traditional burials on Garden Island.
      b-2) REMEDIATION FOR DESECRATION BY UNAUTHORIZED BURIAL:
         i) SACRED NON-BURIAL SITE: The stone circle Sacred Site on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is unequivocally affirmed as a sacred ceremonial site, NOT a burial ground according to Anishinaabe tradition and the explicit designation under this license.
         ii) DESECRATION DECLARED: Any unauthorized burial or interment of human remains within this Sacred Site or its Cultural Landscape constitutes a profound Desecration (Section 1(o)), a grievous violation of Anishinaabe spiritual and cultural integrity, an affront to the Rights Holder's stewardship, a breach of GTBOCI sovereignty, and a severe violation of the terms of this license.
         iii) ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO DEMAND REMEDIATION: Grounded in inherent sovereignty, cultural stewardship responsibilities, the sacred nature of the site, international principles (UNDRIP), and the explicit terms herein, the Rights Holder, their designated Successor Authority (per Section 10.2), or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians possess the absolute, non-negotiable right to demand and compel immediate remediation of any such Desecration. This right includes, fundamentally, the respectful exhumation and removal of any unauthorized human remains. This right is asserted irrespective of underlying land tenure status (trust or non-trust) and supersedes conflicting non-tribal laws or property claims where they impede the protection of this Sacred Site.
          iv) MANDATED REMEDIATION PROCESS: Upon discovery of unauthorized human remains within the Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape:
               (1) IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION: The discovering party must immediately cease any disturbance and notify the Rights Holder (or Successor Authority) and the GTBOCI Tribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO).
               (2) CONSULTATION WITH RELATIVES/DESCENDANTS: The Rights Holder/Successor Authority/GTBOCI shall make reasonable efforts to identify and consult in good faith with the closest living relatives or lineal descendants of the deceased regarding the respectful exhumation, handling, and reburial of the remains.
               (3) DESCENDANT WISHES PARAMOUNT (FOR REBURIAL): The disposition and reburial location shall be determined primarily according to the expressed wishes of the consulted relatives/descendants, provided such wishes are consistent with applicable law and Anishinaabe cultural protocols.
               (4) REBURIAL PROHIBITED ON SITE: Under NO circumstances shall reburial occur anywhere within the designated Sacred Site or Cultural Landscape of the stone circle. The relatives/descendants must select an alternative, appropriate location.
               (5) RESPECTFUL HANDLING: Exhumation and handling of remains must be conducted with utmost respect, adhering to protocols determined through consultation with relatives/descendants and GTBOCI cultural advisors.
               (6) RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS: All costs associated with notification, consultation, archaeological/forensic expertise (if required), exhumation, cultural protocols, transportation, and reburial shall be the sole responsibility of the individual(s), entity(ies), or estate(s) responsible for the initial unauthorized burial/Desecration. The Rights Holder/Successor Authority/GTBOCI shall have the right to pursue legal action to recover these costs.
          v) JURISDICTION AND ENFORCEMENT: Any dispute concerning the interpretation, application, or enforcement of this remediation clause, including compelling remediation or cost recovery, falls under the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the GTBOCI Tribal Court as specified in Section 11. Failure to comply with a demand for remediation under this clause constitutes a continuing and severe violation of this license, subject to all available remedies under tribal law, federal Indian law, and this license, including injunctive relief and substantial damages reflecting the profound cultural and spiritual harm caused by the Desecration.
       c) MIDEWIWIN SOCIETY ADVISORY ROLE: Regarding the Midewiwin society:
          i) Only the Midewiwin of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) and their descendants (recognizing the historical diaspora described in the Preamble) shall be considered relevant to this project;
          ii) The Midewiwin shall serve exclusively in an advisory capacity, providing traditional guidance without holding any governing power, and only if they are available, existent, and their guidance does not contradict the expressed wants and priorities of the Rights Holder;
          iii) ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall recognize the Midewiwin as keepers of sacred knowledge, including the Seven Fires Prophecy, while maintaining the Rights Holder's ultimate authority over the project;
          iv) Appropriate protocols shall be maintained regarding what knowledge can be shared, with whom, and under what circumstances, with the Rights Holder's determinations taking precedence over all other considerations.
          v) CONTINUATION FUNDING: If the Midewiwin of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) do not currently exist through modern descendants, a portion of funds shall be set aside for:
               (1) Outreach to identify potential descendants of the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) community;
               (3) Furthering the integration of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) descendants into the Midewiwin society;
               (4) All such funding shall be administered through the Trust established in Section 10.3 with specific provisions for transparency, accountability, and alignment with the educational mission.
          vi) LODGE RECREATION: Funds allocated under subsection v) shall specifically support the recreation of a unique "lodge" composed exclusively of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) descendants who shall:
               (1) Maintain and further the specific traditions and ceremonial practices unique to the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) community;
               (2) Serve in an exclusively advisory capacity to the trusts, educational institutions, ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo), and other entities established under this license;
               (3) Provide traditional guidance while holding no governance authority or decision-making power over operational, financial, or administrative matters;
               (4) Receive appropriate support and recognition for their cultural role while maintaining the clear separation between advisory functions and governance authority established in this section.
          vii) PREFERENTIAL HIRING AND EDUCATIONAL PROVISIONS: Should the ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) Midewiwin descendants seek to participate in governance, authority, or decision-making roles, the following provisions shall apply:
               (1) QUALIFIED DESCENDANTS PREFERENCE: ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island) Midewiwin descendants shall be given strict hiring preference for any position, provided they possess industry standard qualifications at levels equal to or exceeding those required for the position;
               (2) EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIZATION: Those lacking required qualifications shall be prioritized in the educational programs and institutions established under this license to enable their eventual participation;
               (3) MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS: Position standards shall strictly remain at the highest industry levels regardless of preferential hiring provisions to best further the goals of this license, the life of the Rights Holder, and the Rights Holder's legacy;
               (4) MERIT-BASED ADVANCEMENT: While initial hiring may incorporate preference, subsequent advancement shall be based solely on demonstrated performance, achievement of objectives, and adherence to the values established in this license;
               (5) PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY: All individuals, including those hired under preferential provisions, shall be subject to the same performance evaluations, accountability measures, and standards of excellence.

       c-1) STONE CIRCLE SYMBOL TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT PROTECTION: The astronomically and ceremonially significant stone circle of ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda) is hereby explicitly established as an official symbol and mark for ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO) with the following protections and authorizations:
          i) TRADEMARK PROTECTION STATUS: The stone circle design and its visual representations are hereby designated as a protected trademark/official mark of the Rights Holder, with all associated exclusive rights recognized under trademark law, including the right to use, license, and protect the mark from unauthorized use or dilution.
          ii) COPYRIGHT PROTECTION: All visual representations, artistic renderings, graphical designs, digital images, and other creative expressions of the stone circle are protected under copyright law, with all exclusive rights of reproduction, adaptation, distribution, display, and derivative creation reserved to the Rights Holder.
          iii) NANOBOOZHOO USAGE AUTHORIZATION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO) is hereby specifically and exclusively authorized to use the stone circle as its official symbol in:
               (1) Marketing materials, promotional content, and advertising;
               (2) Branding, logos, icons, and visual identity elements;
               (3) Digital interfaces, websites, applications, and platforms;
               (4) Educational materials, publications, and presentations;
               (5) Merchandise, products, and commercial applications;
               (6) Any other reasonable applications that advance the purposes established in Section 10.10.
          iv) AUTHORIZED DERIVATIVE WORKS: The Rights Holder authorizes the creation of derivative works based on the stone circle symbol exclusively for the purposes of ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo/NANOBOOZHOO)'s operations, marketing, branding, and promotion, subject to:
               (1) Maintenance of the essential cultural integrity and spiritual significance of the original stone circle;
               (2) Consistency with the indigenous cyberpunk aesthetic described in this license;
               (3) Review and approval processes established by the Rights Holder or successor authorities;
               (4) Prohibitions against stereotypical, demeaning, or culturally inappropriate representations.
          v) CERTIFICATION MARK STATUS: The stone circle symbol shall function as a certification mark indicating authentic connection to the Rights Holder and adherence to the values, principles, and requirements established in this license.
          vi) PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT: Unauthorized use of the stone circle symbol is strictly prohibited and shall constitute:
               (1) Trademark/official mark infringement subject to legal action and remedies;

          viii) PERPETUAL DURATION: The trademark/official mark and copyright protections for the stone circle symbol shall continue in perpetuity, without the limitations of term typically associated with these rights, based on its status as a Traditional Cultural Expression of continuing cultural significance.
          ix) RELATION TO TCE PROTECTION: This trademark/official mark protection operates in conjunction with, not in place of, the TCE protections established in Section 10.10.3(b-1), providing complementary protection through distinct legal mechanisms.

       d) CULTURAL SOVEREIGNTY PRESERVATION: ᓇᓄᐴᔔ (Nanoboozhoo) shall actively work to:

**11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND JURISDICTION**
   By accessing, using, or otherwise interacting with the Work, you (the "User") irrevocably agree that this license constitutes a binding contract between you and the Rights Holder. As a fundamental, non-negotiable condition of this contract, you expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and dispute resolution framework set forth below. Any attempt to initiate legal proceedings in a forum other than those specified herein, or any challenge to the jurisdiction of the designated tribal forums, shall be considered a material breach of this license, resulting in immediate revocation of all rights granted hereunder and subjecting the User to all enforcement actions and remedies outlined herein.

   The terms, interpretation, and enforcement of this license incorporate and are informed by tribal sovereignty principles, federal Indian law, traditional Indigenous law of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and international Indigenous rights frameworks:

   11.1 PRIMARY JURISDICTION HIERARCHY: The following jurisdictional hierarchy shall apply to any and all disputes arising under or related to this license, including but not limited to disputes concerning the interpretation or enforcement of protections for Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), Sacred Sites (including the stone circle on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ / Aamik'Waakanda, land held in trust by GTBOCI), and Cultural Landscapes as defined herein:
   
       a) BEAVER ISLAND BAND PRIORITY: If and when the Beaver Island Band (historically centered on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik'Waakanda / Beaver Island)) establishes its own tribal court, legal forum, or formalized dispute resolution body (whether through federal recognition, reorganization of descendants, or other means of formal establishment), such forum shall have primary and first jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising under or related to this license. Such forum shall incorporate both written and unwritten traditional and customary law in its adjudication, recognizing the paramount cultural significance of the subject matter to the Rights Holder and the Beaver Island Band.
       
       b) GTBOCI JURISDICTION: If the forum described in 11.1(a) does not exist or is determined by its own authority to be unavailable or impractical for a specific dispute, the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) Tribal Court shall have primary and exclusive jurisdiction. The GTBOCI Tribal Court shall incorporate both written tribal law and unwritten traditional and customary law in its adjudication, recognizing the paramount cultural significance of the subject matter to the Rights Holder and the Tribe.

   11.1A JURISDICTION SPECIFIC TO AUTHORIZED SACRED SITE MONITORING: Notwithstanding the general hierarchy in 11.1, any dispute arising *directly* from the implementation, operation, data handling, or consequences of the Authorized Sacred Site Monitoring activities defined in Section 8(g) shall be addressed according to the following specific jurisdictional order, acknowledging the trust responsibilities for the specific land parcels involved:
       a) FIRST PRIORITY: The Beaver Island Band forum established pursuant to Section 11.1(a), if available.
       b) SECOND PRIORITY (Site-Specific): If the Beaver Island Band forum is unavailable:
          (i) For disputes arising from monitoring activities specifically concerning the Garden Island burial grounds (land held in trust by LTBB), jurisdiction shall lie with the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB) Tribal Court.
          (ii) For disputes arising from monitoring activities specifically concerning the Beaver Island Stone Circle (land held in trust by GTBOCI), jurisdiction shall lie with the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI) Tribal Court.
       c) This subsection governs only disputes directly related to Section 8(g) activities; all other disputes remain subject to the broader hierarchy established in Section 11.

   11.2 SECONDARY JURISDICTIONS AND RELATED TRIBAL INTERESTS: In circumstances where proceedings in the forums specified in Section 11.1 *or 11.1A* are determined by those forums themselves to be unavailable or impractical for a specific dispute, or where enforcement of a tribal court judgment is sought in another forum, the following forums may have concurrent or subsequent jurisdiction, subject always to the principles of tribal sovereignty and exhaustion of tribal remedies. Furthermore, for disputes specifically concerning the Garden Island (Gitigaan Minising) burial grounds (land held in trust by LTBB), the jurisdictional interest and potential role of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians shall be appropriately considered and respected within the dispute resolution process, consistent with principles of comity and inter-tribal relations:
       a) The United States Federal District Court with geographic jurisdiction encompassing the lands of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, particularly for matters arising under federal Indian law or requiring interpretation of federal statutes or treaties.
       b) If federal court jurisdiction is unavailable, the courts of the State of Michigan, solely to the extent necessary and permissible under federal Indian law and principles of comity, and provided that tribal law and perspectives are given appropriate weight.
       c) For international disputes, the choice of forum and applicable law shall prioritize mechanisms that respect Indigenous sovereignty and international indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., WIPO procedures for TK/TCEs, application of lex originis principles), as determined appropriate by the Rights Holder.

   11.3 JURISDICTIONAL PRINCIPLES: The interpretation and application of jurisdictional rules shall be guided by:
       a) The paramount status of tribal law, custom, and treaty rights, which shall supersede conflicting state or common law principles where applicable.
       b) The established Indian canons of construction, requiring ambiguities in laws, treaties, and agreements (including this license) to be interpreted liberally in favor of tribal interests and sovereignty.
       c) The doctrine of tribal court exhaustion, which generally requires parties to exhaust remedies in tribal court before seeking relief in federal or state courts, particularly for disputes arising on tribal lands or involving tribal members and governance.
       d) 2024-2025 SCOTUS IP holdings, prioritizing tribal forums for cultural IP disputes.

   11.4 TRADITIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The Rights Holder explicitly reserves the right, consistent with GTBOCI law and custom, to utilize or require participation in traditional GTBOCI dispute resolution methods, forums, or councils of elders, either as an alternative or supplement to judicial proceedings. Decisions reached through such traditional processes shall be accorded respect and weight within the community and potentially by other forums under principles of comity.

   11.5 GOVERNING LAW HIERARCHY: Disputes shall be resolved according to the following hierarchy of applicable law:
       a) The express terms of this license;
       b) The laws, customs, and traditions of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians;
       c) Federal Indian law, including but not limited to relevant treaties, statutes, regulations, and case law;
       d) International instruments concerning Indigenous rights, such as UNDRIP;
       e) General principles of intellectual property law, modified as necessary to account for the unique nature of Indigenous intellectual property, TK, and TCEs.

   11.6 ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The parties may, upon mutual written agreement, submit disputes to alternative resolution mechanisms that respect Indigenous protocols and tribal sovereignty, including:
       a) Traditional peacemaking or other culturally appropriate dispute resolution processes of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians;
       b) Mediation or arbitration conducted under tribal auspices or by qualified neutrals with expertise in both intellectual property and federal Indian law;
       c) Other culturally appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms recognized by Indigenous custom or tribal law.
       d) REMEDIES ALLOCATION TO TRUST/S: Notwithstanding the specific dispute resolution mechanism used, all **Total Proceeds** (as defined in Section 1(i)) resulting from any dispute resolution process under this license shall be allocated as follows:
          i) During the lifetime of the Rights Holder, such outcomes shall be paid **to the Trustee of the living trust established pursuant to Section 9A (LIVING TRUST AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ASSET MANAGEMENT), for the benefit of the Rights Holder**, unless the Rights Holder directs such outcomes to be paid directly toward the funding and advancement of the purposes outlined in Section 10.3 pursuant to their discretionary authority under Section 9A.8, or unless the Rights Holder is no longer able to manage such assets (due to incapacity or voluntary delegation), in which case outcomes shall continue to be directed to said living trust to be managed for the benefit of the Rights Holder during their lifetime according to the terms governing that trust.
          ii) Following the death of the Rights Holder, all such outcomes shall be automatically and exclusively directed to the ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi) Legacy Trust established pursuant to Section 10.3 (the **Legacy Beneficiary**), to be managed according to the prioritized purposes outlined in Section 10.3.d, including the primary focus on Beaver Island Band establishment and descendant support, followed by High Island cultural site recovery, broader educational support, and potential mainland higher education institution development as funds allow and as prioritized therein.
          iii) This remedies allocation provision shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the tribal sovereignty principles articulated throughout this license and shall take precedence over any conflicting remedies provisions in applicable non-tribal law.
          iv) Any attempt to circumvent this remedies allocation provision shall constitute a separate and severe violation of this license, triggering all available enforcement remedies.

   11.7 EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENT: All parties to disputes arising under this license must fully exhaust tribal court remedies before seeking adjudication or enforcement in any non-tribal forum, consistent with the federal doctrine of exhaustion of tribal remedies (see National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U.S. 845 (1985); Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U.S. 9 (1987)). This specifically requires exhaustion of remedies in the Beaver Island Band forum (if established pursuant to Section 11.1(a)) and/or the GTBOCI Tribal Court (pursuant to Section 11.1(b)) as applicable under the jurisdictional hierarchy established in Section 11.1.

   11.8 JURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGES: Any challenge to the jurisdiction of the Beaver Island Band forum (established pursuant to Section 11.1(a)) or the GTBOCI Tribal Court must be raised exclusively within that respective forum in the first instance, and that forum's determination of its jurisdiction shall be given substantial deference in all subsequent proceedings in any forum.

   11.9 ENFORCEMENT COSTS: In addition to any other remedies available under this license, tribal law, federal Indian law, or other applicable law, any party found to be in breach of any term or condition of this license by a competent forum pursuant to Section 11 shall be liable for and shall pay to the Rights Holder (or their designated successor or the Trust established under Section 10.3, consistent with the allocation provisions of Section 11.6.d) all reasonable costs incurred in enforcing the terms of this license. Such costs include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees, court costs, investigation expenses (including digital forensics costs pursuant to Section 9A.7 where applicable), expert witness fees, and any other expenses directly related to addressing the breach and securing compliance. This provision for cost recovery shall not be limited by Section 14 (Limitation of Liability).

   11.10 All disputes involving TK/TCEs shall apply lex originis principles per WIPO standards.

   11.10 International disputes apply lex originis, prioritizing GTBOCI law and UNDRIP. Users consent to enforcement via New York Convention for arbitral awards.

**12. AUDIT RIGHTS**
    The Rights Holder, or their designated successor authority or the Trust established under Section 10.3 (hereafter 'Auditing Party'), shall have the right, upon providing reasonable written notice (no less than 10 business days), to audit and inspect the records, systems, facilities, and practices of any individual, entity, corporation, institution, or other party granted any form of access to or use of the Work under this license (hereafter 'Audited Party'). The purpose of such audits shall be to verify compliance with all terms and conditions of this license, including but not limited to: usage restrictions (Section 7, Section 8), adherence to Prior Informed Consent requirements (Section 9), compliance with TK Label protocols (Section 4), data governance obligations, attribution requirements (Section 3), and prohibitions on unauthorized modifications or distributions. Audits shall be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Audited Party\'s operations. The Audited Party shall provide reasonable cooperation and access to necessary personnel, records, and systems. If an audit reveals a material breach of this license, the Audited Party shall bear the full costs associated with the audit, in addition to any other remedies pursued by the Auditing Party. Confidential information of the Audited Party obtained during an audit shall be treated with appropriate confidentiality by the Auditing Party, subject to disclosure obligations required for license enforcement or under applicable law.

    Audits may include digital forensics per Section 9A.7. Breaching parties bear all costs, including minimum $10,000 liquidated damages per violation, to enable wealth reclamation for communities.

**13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES**
    THE WORK IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY WORK IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW (INCLUDING TRIBAL LAW AND FEDERAL INDIAN LAW AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 11), THE RIGHTS HOLDER PROVIDES THE WORK AS-IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY.

**14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW (INCLUDING TRIBAL LAW AND FEDERAL INDIAN LAW AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 11), IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (SUCH AS DELIBERATE AND GROSSLY NEGLIGENT ACTS) OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, SHALL THE RIGHTS HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

**15. SEVERABILITY AND PERPETUITY**
    This license is intended to be perpetual and apply to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. If any provision of this license is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction by a competent forum (giving due deference to the chosen tribal forum), such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this license or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. The provision in question shall be reformed, construed, and enforced in such jurisdiction to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, in a manner that most closely achieves the original purpose and intent of this license, particularly the protection of Indigenous rights, sovereignty, and wealth reclamation principles. This license shall be interpreted holistically to uphold these core principles.

    If any provision conflicts with public policy, it shall be reformed to align with indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., UNDRIP) while preserving intent, per sui generis best practices.

**16. NOTIFICATION AND COMMUNICATION**
    All formal notifications, requests for Prior Informed Consent (PIC), reports, or other communications required or permitted under this license shall be delivered in writing to the Rights Holder\'s designated contact information provided below, or, where appropriate and specified, to the officially designated offices of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

**17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS**
    This document constitutes the entire agreement between the user of the Work and the Rights Holder concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written. No amendment or modification of this License shall be effective unless explicitly stated as an updated version of this license by the Rights Holder. No waiver of any provision of this license shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Rights Holder.

**18. SUPPORT FOR COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTIONS**
    Users of the Work acknowledge the paramount importance of protecting Sacred Sites and Cultural Landscapes, including the stone circle on ᐋᒥᒃ ᐙᑲᓐᑕ (Aamik\'Waakanda) (land held in trust by GTBOCI). While this license establishes specific controls related to the licensed Work, users agree, as a matter of principle and respect for Indigenous sovereignty and cultural heritage, not to undertake actions governed by this license that would knowingly undermine or obstruct separate efforts by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to secure additional legal or physical protections for such sites (e.g., through conservation easements, land designations, physical access controls, or other mechanisms). This section also explicitly protects the Rights Holder's works as an educator, artist, engineer, and consultant, including classes, content, designs, and consultations, by deeming any unauthorized use thereof a breach subject to all remedies herein.

**19. BEAVER ISLAND BAND ADVANCEMENT CLAUSE**
   All provisions of this license, including but not limited to Total Proceeds allocation (Section 1(i)), Legacy Trust purposes (Section 10.3.d), and educational priorities (Sections 10.4-10.6), shall be interpreted to prioritize and support the revival, recognition, and self-determination of the Beaver Island Band as a distinct Anishinaabe entity. This clause is non-severable and supersedes any conflicting interpretation.

   a) **Tribal Court Exhaustion:**
      i) All parties must first exhaust available tribal court remedies before seeking relief in any other forum
      ii) This requirement applies regardless of the basis for the claim or the citizenship status of the parties
      iii) Tribal court decisions are entitled to full faith and credit or comity in other jurisdictions

   b) **Choice of Forum:**
      i) The Rights Holder retains absolute discretion to select the most appropriate forum within the established hierarchy
      ii) Selection of a particular forum does not waive the right to later invoke jurisdiction of another appropriate forum
      iii) Forum selection must prioritize protection of tribal sovereignty and Indigenous rights

   c) **Cross-Jurisdictional Enforcement:**
      i) Judgments obtained in tribal courts shall be enforceable in federal and state courts
      ii) Enforcement actions must respect tribal sovereignty and self-determination
      iii) State courts must apply principles of comity to tribal court decisions

   11.4. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as:
   a) Waiving the sovereign immunity of any tribal nation
   b) Consenting to jurisdiction beyond what is explicitly granted
   c) Diminishing tribal sovereign rights or authorities

The Rights Holder encourages registration of copyrightable elements with the U.S. Copyright Office or equivalents. Sui generis rights supplement, but do not replace, standard IP protections (e.g., moral rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106A). In jurisdictions without TK recognition, enforce via contract law.

Users may optionally apply CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 to derivatives, provided it subordinates to this license's TK Labels, PIC, and CARE Principles. Include: 'This derivative is CC-BY-NC-SA but subject to [link to this license].' Ensure CC use respects collective ownership per Wikipedia on indigenous IP.

11.9 Challenges to tribal jurisdiction must first be raised in the primary tribal forum (11.1). Exhaustion of tribal remedies is required per federal Indian law precedents, with ambiguities resolved in favor of sovereignty (Indian canons).

Users may subscribe for update notifications at [email/contact]. Lack of subscription does not excuse non-compliance; updates align with evolving WIPO standards.

**7A. REPATRIATION PROTOCOL FOR MISAPPROPRIATED TK**
Upon breach involving TK/TCEs, users must repatriate all derived data/materials per CARE Principles, with destruction verified by audit.
