**Dear Director:**

I am writing on behalf of the **Beaver Island Band of Indians** to formally submit our Letter of Intent to petition for federal acknowledgment as an Indian tribe under the provisions of 25 CFR Part 83, "Procedures for Establishing that an American Indian Group Exists as an Indian Tribe."

**1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE PETITIONING GROUP**

The Beaver Island Band of Indians is a distinct American Indian entity that has maintained continuous identification as an American Indian community since historical times. Our community traces its lineage directly to Chief ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Kinwaabakizi) of the Beaver Island Band and maintains ancestral connections to the sovereign Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTB) and Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians (LTBB), of which our members constitute approximately one-quarter of the combined population. According to verified enrollment records, GTB has approximately 3,985 enrolled members and LTBB has over 4,500 enrolled members, with our community representing a significant portion of both tribes' membership base.

**2. PURPOSE AND LEGAL BASIS**

This Letter of Intent formally initiates our petition for federal acknowledgment under 25 CFR Part 83, as recently revised and effective February 14, 2025. We acknowledge the seven mandatory criteria established in §83.11 and commit to providing comprehensive evidence demonstrating our compliance with each requirement:

(a) **Indian Entity Identification** - Continuous identification as an American Indian entity since 1900, with historical federal recognition through the 1836 Treaty of Washington specifically identifying our community as the "Beaver Island Band of Indians"

(b) **Distinct Community** - Existence as a distinct community from historical times to present, evidenced by our separate identification in federal treaties and continuous cultural practices

(c) **Political Authority** - Maintained political influence or authority over members as an autonomous entity, historically recognized through treaty participation and hereditary chieftainship

(d) **Governing Document** - Present governing document with membership criteria

(e) **Descent** - Membership descended from historical Indian tribe(s), including direct descent from treaty signatory leadership

(f) **Unique Membership** - Membership not principally composed of members of other federally recognized tribes

(g) **Congressional Termination** - No congressional legislation terminating federal relationship

**3. HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL FOUNDATION**

Our community's historical continuity is evidenced through:

- **Direct Treaty Participation**: Our great great grandfather, as a recognized chief of the Beaver Island Band of Indians, was a principal signatory to the Treaty of Washington (1836) between the United States and the Ottawa and Chippewa nations. This treaty, concluded on March 28, 1836, specifically identifies our community as the "Beaver Island Band of Indians" and reserves "The Beaver islands of Lake Michigan for the use of the Beaver-island Indians." The treaty ceded approximately 13,837,207 acres (37% of current Michigan) and established our community's formal relationship with the federal government. Our family's surname is clearly marked among the signatories, demonstrating our community's recognized political status and sovereignty during the formative period of Michigan statehood.

- **Federal Recognition Through Treaty**: The 1836 Treaty of Washington represents formal federal acknowledgment of our community as a distinct political entity. Our great great grandfather's signature on this treaty establishes our community's historical federal relationship and recognized political authority, directly supporting the "Indian Entity Identification" and "Political Authority" criteria under 25 CFR Part 83.

- **Royal Recognition**: Following the Indian Wars of the 1830s, our family was presented with a medal from the King of England, recognizing our great great grandfather's leadership and our community's significant role in regional affairs. This international recognition further validates our distinct community status and political authority during this critical historical period.

- **Sacred Sites Protection**: Our grandfather, as the last traditional burial practitioner for indigenous islanders, conducted traditional burials at the **Garden Island Indian Burial Grounds** and maintained cultural practices at the **Beaver Island Stone Circle**. These sacred sites represent continuous cultural and spiritual connection to our ancestral lands.

- **Genealogical Documentation**: Direct descent from Chief Kinwaabakizi and documented lineage through the Grand Traverse Band enrollment records.

- **Cultural Continuity**: Preservation of Anishinaabek traditions, language elements, and cultural practices passed down through generations.

- **Historical Migration and Cultural Persistence**: During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when traditional Anishinaabe ceremonies and religious practices were systematically outlawed and persecuted under federal policies, many of our community members, including the Osawanimkii family branch and others, sought refuge across the U.S.-Canada border to preserve our cultural practices. This migration demonstrates the resilience and interconnectedness of Anishinaabe communities across national boundaries while maintaining our distinct cultural identity and traditional practices. The fact that our community maintained its cultural continuity despite these historical challenges strengthens our claim to distinct community status under the federal acknowledgment criteria.

**4. DISTINCT COMMUNITY AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY**

The Beaver Island Band has functioned as a separate politically autonomous community, maintaining:

- **Treaty-Based Sovereignty**: Our community's political authority is historically grounded in the 1836 Treaty of Washington, with our great great grandfather serving as a principal signatory specifically representing the "Beaver Island Band of Indians." This establishes our community's recognized political status and autonomous decision-making authority under federal law.

- **Federal Recognition Through Treaty**: The 1836 treaty represents formal federal acknowledgment of our community as a distinct political entity, directly supporting our claim to autonomous political authority and distinct community status.

- **International Recognition**: The royal medal from the King of England demonstrates international acknowledgment of our community's political leadership and distinct identity, further supporting our claim to autonomous political authority.

- **Traditional Governance**: Hereditary chieftainship system with documented succession
- **Community Decision-Making**: Autonomous decision-making processes independent of other tribal governments
- **Cultural Autonomy**: Distinct cultural practices and community identity separate from other recognized tribes

**5. COMMITMENT TO THE FEDERAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT PROCESS**

We commit to:

- Providing comprehensive documentation addressing all seven criteria
- Participating fully in the OFA review process
- Responding promptly to all requests for additional information
- Maintaining transparency throughout the acknowledgment process

**7. REQUEST FOR ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

We respectfully request that the Office of Federal Acknowledgment:

1. Acknowledge receipt of this Letter of Intent
2. Provide guidance on the petition submission process
3. Assign a case number for our petition
4. Schedule initial consultation to discuss our case

**8. SACRED SITES PROTECTION URGENCY**

We emphasize the critical importance of federal acknowledgment for the protection of our sacred sites, particularly the **Beaver Island Stone Circle** and **Garden Island Indian Burial Grounds**. Federal recognition will enable us to:

- Exercise tribal sovereignty over these culturally significant locations
- Implement traditional cultural practices and ceremonies
- Protect burial sites from development and desecration
- Preserve our cultural heritage for future generations

**9. CROSS-BORDER CULTURAL PRESERVATION AND THE OSAWANIMKII FAMILY**

Our community's historical connection to the Osawanimkii family and other Anishinaabe families who migrated to Canada during periods of religious persecution demonstrates our commitment to cultural preservation and continuity. This migration pattern, documented in both U.S. and Canadian historical records, shows how our community maintained its distinct identity and traditional practices despite federal policies that outlawed Native American religious ceremonies and cultural practices. The Osawanimkii family branch and others who sought refuge in Canada continued to practice our traditional ceremonies and maintain our cultural heritage, ensuring that our traditions survived and could be passed down to future generations. This historical resilience and cultural persistence further supports our claim to distinct community status and strengthens our petition for federal acknowledgment.

**10. TREATY RIGHTS AND HISTORICAL FEDERAL RECOGNITION**

Our community's federal acknowledgment is fundamentally supported by our established treaty relationship with the United States:

- **1836 Treaty of Washington**: Our great great grandfather's signature on the Treaty of Washington (1836) specifically under "Beaver Island Band of Indians" establishes our community's recognized political status and federal relationship. This treaty, which ceded approximately 13,837,207 acres in northwest Lower Peninsula and eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, demonstrates our community's historical federal acknowledgment and political authority.

- **Direct Federal Relationship**: Our community's participation in treaty negotiations and the federal government's acceptance of our signatures demonstrates historical acknowledgment of our political authority and distinct community status. The treaty specifically identifies our community as a separate political entity, supporting our claim to distinct community status.

- **Ceded Territory Rights**: As signatories to the 1836 treaty, our community maintains hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in our traditional territories, demonstrating ongoing federal recognition of our community's distinct rights and interests.

- **Political Continuity**: Our community's political authority has been continuously maintained since the 1836 treaty signing, with our hereditary chieftainship system preserving the political leadership that was recognized by the federal government during treaty negotiations.

**CONCLUSION**

The Beaver Island Band of Indians respectfully submits this Letter of Intent as the first step toward federal acknowledgment. Our case presents compelling evidence of continuous existence as a distinct Indian community, including:

- **Direct treaty participation** through our great great grandfather's signature on the 1836 Treaty of Washington specifically under "Beaver Island Band of Indians"
- **Historical federal recognition** through formal treaty relationship with the United States
- **International recognition** through royal honors from the King of England
- **Continuous cultural and political authority** maintained since historical times
- **Compliance with all seven criteria** established under 25 CFR Part 83

The 1836 Treaty of Washington provides irrefutable evidence of our community's historical federal acknowledgment and distinct political status, making our case for federal acknowledgment particularly compelling and well-documented.

We look forward to working with the Office of Federal Acknowledgment throughout this process and are committed to providing any additional information or documentation required.

**Respectfully submitted,**
