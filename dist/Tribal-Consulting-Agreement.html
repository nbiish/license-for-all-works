      <p><strong>RECITALS</strong></p>
      
      <p>A. Consultant possesses unique expertise, knowledge, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and perspectives derived from their position as a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation. This expertise includes, but is not limited to, areas such as tribal commercial fishing, treaty rights, Indigenous law and governance, digital systems, data sovereignty, business development, infrastructure, and the intersection of technology with Indigenous intellectual property (IP) and TK, often grounded in knowledge gained through study with traditional and ceremonial teachers and holding ceremonial positions within the community.</p>
      
      <p>B. Consultant's work and knowledge sharing operate under principles grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, TK, and TCEs, as more fully articulated in the Consultant's <strong>COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTIONS</strong> ("Guiding License Principles"), available at <a href="https://github.com/nbiish/license-for-all-works/blob/main/LICENSE">https://github.com/nbiish/license-for-all-works/blob/main/LICENSE</a>, the terms and principles of which are incorporated herein by reference where applicable to the protection of knowledge and information shared under this Agreement.</p>
      
      <p>C.

            iv. Compensation for cultural, spiritual, and collective harm caused by the breach, acknowledging that such harm may not be fully quantifiable in monetary terms but requires significant restitution as determined under applicable tribal law and custom.

        <p>c. <strong>Recovery of Costs:</strong> Client shall be liable for all legal fees, expert witness fees, court costs, travel expenses, and other professional fees incurred by Consultant in enforcing this Agreement or remedying a breach, consistent with Section 7.3(a) and 8.3 of the Guiding License Principles.

        <li><p><strong>No Termination for Incapacitation:</strong> Client shall not use Consultant's temporary detention, incarceration, or incapacitation as grounds for termination of this Agreement, provided that arrangements can be made for the continuation of Services or their resumption upon Consultant's release or recovery. If Services must be temporarily suspended, the Term of this Agreement shall be extended by a period equal to the duration of such suspension.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Client shall maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information about Consultant's detention, incarceration, or incapacitation, and shall not disclose such information to any third party without Consultant's explicit consent, except as required by law.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Survival of Payment Obligations:</strong> Client's obligation to pay for Services already rendered shall survive regardless of Consultant's detention, incarceration, or incapacitation, and shall not be used as grounds to withhold or delay payment.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Court-Appointed Fiduciary/Representative:</strong> In the absence of a pre-designated representative or agent, Client agrees to honor payment instructions from any court-appointed fiduciary, guardian, conservator, or other legal representative authorized to act on Consultant's behalf. Client shall be entitled to rely upon court documentation evidencing such appointment without further inquiry.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Tribal Authority Designation:</strong> In the absence of a pre-designated representative or agent and where no court-appointed fiduciary exists, Client agrees to honor payment instructions from an authorized representative of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians who has been designated by tribal authorities to act on Consultant's behalf in accordance with tribal law and governance procedures.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Default Payment Protocol:</strong> If Consultant is unable to receive direct payment and no designated representative, court-appointed fiduciary, or tribal authority has provided alternative payment instructions within thirty (30) days of Client's knowledge of Consultant's detention or incapacitation, Client shall:</p>
        <p>i. Place all amounts due to Consultant in an interest-bearing escrow account specifically designated for this purpose;</p>
        <p>ii. Maintain such funds in escrow until (a) Consultant provides payment instructions, (b) a designated representative, court-appointed fiduciary, or tribal authority provides valid payment instructions, or (c) Consultant resumes direct receipt of payments;</p>
        <p>iii. Provide written documentation to Consultant's last known address and to the tribal authorities of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians regarding the status and location of escrowed funds, with updates at least quarterly;</p>
        <p>iv. Release the escrowed funds, including any accrued interest, promptly upon receiving proper instructions from Consultant or an authorized representative.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Emergency Needs Payment:</strong> Notwithstanding the absence of a pre-designated representative, if Client receives credible information that Consultant requires funds for immediate legal representation, medical care, or other critical needs relating to Consultant's detention or incapacitation, Client shall make reasonable efforts to facilitate payment for such needs from amounts due to Consultant. This may include direct payments to legal counsel, medical providers, or other service providers upon presentation of invoices for services rendered to Consultant. Client shall document all such payments and provide an accounting to Consultant or Consultant's representative.</p></li>
