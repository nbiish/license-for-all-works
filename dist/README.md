## How to Print with Proper Formatting

1. Open the `Tribal-Consulting-Agreement.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

   - Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac)
   - OR select "Print" from the browser menu

3. In the print dialog:
   - Set paper size to **Letter** or **A4**
   - Set margins to **Normal** or **Default**
   - Enable "Background Graphics" if you want colored elements
   - Set "Headers and Footers" to **None** for a cleaner look

## Formatting Improvements

The HTML version includes several formatting improvements:
- Consistent indentation for lists and sublists
- Proper spacing for client initial lines
- Well-formatted checkboxes
- Strategic page breaks to avoid awkward section splits
- Better alignment for numbered sections

## Troubleshooting

If you experience formatting issues:

1. Try using a different browser
2. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
3. If saving as PDF, try the browser's built-in "Save as PDF" option rather than using a PDF printer driver
