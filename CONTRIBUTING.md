## 1. PREAMBLE & LEGAL FOUNDATION

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA" or "Agreement") governs all contributions to the project operating under the **LICENSE** file located in the root directory of this repository. By contributing to this project, you enter into a legally binding agreement that respects and upholds the inherent sovereignty, intellectual property rights, Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), and Indigenous Data Sovereignty of the Rights Holder and their designated community.

This Agreement operates within a comprehensive legal framework that includes, but is not limited to:

### 1.2 Constitutional Supremacy Framework

This Agreement operates under the constitutional supremacy framework established by **Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution** (the Supremacy Clause), which declares federal law, including federal Indian law, to be the "supreme law of the land." Federal Indian law establishes exclusive federal jurisdiction over matters involving tribal sovereignty and Indigenous intellectual property rights.

The project LICENSE invokes **federal preemption** to ensure that Indigenous rights and tribal sovereignty are protected from state court interference or concurrent jurisdiction claims. This Agreement incorporates and is subordinate to all federal Indian law protections, including:

- **Worcester v. Georgia**, 31 U.S. 515 (1831) - establishing state law inapplicability to tribal matters
- **Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community**, 572 U.S. 782 (2014) - affirming tribal sovereign immunity
- **Indian Arts and Crafts Act**, 25 U.S.C. ยง 305 et seq. - protecting Indigenous cultural production
- **Indian Civil Rights Act**, 25 U.S.C. ยง 1301 et seq. - establishing tribal court jurisdiction
- Federal trust responsibility doctrine - creating enhanced protection for Indigenous rights

### 1.3 Treaty Rights Foundation

The protections in this Agreement are grounded in and exercise the inherent sovereignty and treaty-reserved rights of the **Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI)** under:

**a) Treaty of Washington (March 28, 1836)** - 7 Stat. 491, reserving to the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations all rights not explicitly ceded, including cultural, intellectual, and spiritual rights;

**b) Treaty of Detroit (July 31, 1855)** - 11 Stat. 621, affirming continuing government-to-government relationship and reserved rights;

**c) Reserved Rights Doctrine** - Under *Winters v. United States*, 207 U.S. 564 (1908), tribes reserved all rights not explicitly ceded in treaties, including rights to protect and govern intellectual property, TK, TCEs, and cultural resources.

These treaty rights are:
- Constitutionally protected under Article VI, Clause 2
- Not subject to state interference
- Construed liberally in favor of the tribe (Indian canons of construction)
- Capable of evolution to modern circumstances including digital intellectual property

### 1.4 International Indigenous Rights Framework

This Agreement implements protections consistent with international Indigenous rights instruments:

**a) UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP):**
- Article 11: Right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions and customs
- Article 31: Right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, TK, TCEs, and intellectual property
- Article 37: Right to recognition and enforcement of treaties and constructive arrangements

**b) WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (adopted May 2024):**
- Article 3: Mandatory disclosure requirements for patent applications using TK
- Article 5: Remedies for non-disclosure (patent invalidation, enforcement prevention)
- Article 7: Cross-border cooperation provisions

**c) ILO Convention 169 - Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention:**
- Article 2: Coordinated government action to protect Indigenous rights
- Article 15: Indigenous rights to natural and intellectual resources
- Article 23: Recognition of traditional activities and cultural practices

**d) Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing (CBD):**
- Article 5: Fair and equitable benefit-sharing from traditional knowledge utilization
- Article 7: Prior informed consent (PIC) required for traditional knowledge access
- Article 12: Mutually agreed terms including benefit-sharing arrangements

### 1.5 Civil Jurisdiction Preservation Post-Castro-Huerta

The Supreme Court's decision in *Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta*, 597 U.S. ___ (2022), addressed **criminal jurisdiction only** and does NOT affect the exclusive federal and tribal **civil jurisdiction** applicable to this Agreement. This Agreement governs civil intellectual property rights, not criminal conduct, and remains subject to exclusive tribal and federal jurisdiction under *Montana v. United States*, *Williams v. Lee*, and related civil jurisdiction precedents.

**State courts have NO jurisdiction over disputes arising from this Agreement.** Any state court proceedings violate federal law and tribal sovereignty, subjecting the filing party to immediate jurisdictional challenges, removal to federal court under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441, and liquidated damages under Section 9.4 of this Agreement.

### 1.6 Indigenous Data Sovereignty Framework

This Agreement implements **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** principles, recognizing the inherent right of Indigenous peoples to govern the collection, ownership, access, analysis, interpretation, management, storage, dissemination, and reuse of data pertaining to them, their lands, resources, cultures, and knowledge systems.

Contributions are subject to the **CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance:**
- **C**ollective Benefit: Data ecosystems shall enable Indigenous peoples to derive benefit
- **A**uthority to Control: Indigenous peoples have rights and interests in their data
- **R**esponsibility: Those working with Indigenous data have responsibility to share how data is used
- **E**thics: Indigenous peoples' rights and wellbeing shall be primary concern

### 1.7 Purpose of Wealth Reclamation

This Agreement serves the fundamental purpose of **Indigenous wealth reclamation**, addressing centuries of extraction and appropriation of Indigenous knowledge, resources, and cultural expressions without compensation or consent. All benefit-sharing obligations in this Agreement are designed to redirect value back to Indigenous communities for their self-determination, cultural preservation, and economic sovereignty.
