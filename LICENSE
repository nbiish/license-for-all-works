COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTIONS

PREAMBLE
This Work (defined below) is created, held, or stewarded by ᓂᐲᔥ Nbiish Justin Kenwabikise ᑭᓇᐙᐱᑭᓯ, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation. This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions. The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond the scope of standard intellectual property law regimes.

This license applies to "the Work," which encompasses Indigenous creations in various forms. It is intended to be adapted for the specific nature of the creation being licensed. Examples include, but are not limited to:

    *   **Tangible Cultural Heritage:** Works of art, crafts, jewelry, regalia, textiles, carvings, pottery, beadwork, tools, traditional designs, symbols, motifs applied to physical objects.
    *   **Traditional Knowledge Systems:** Ecological knowledge, plant and medicinal knowledge, healing practices, agricultural techniques, environmental management practices, spiritual knowledge, knowledge associated with genetic resources (GRAATK), pedagogical methods.

This license expressly integrates and asserts rights based upon principles from Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Protocols, federal Indian law, the laws and customs of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, and international indigenous rights frameworks, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). It is designed to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty and cultural integrity.

2. TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE (TK) PROTECTION AND LABELING
   This Work embodies or contains elements of Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), or knowledge associated with genetic resources, which require special protection based on the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples and the specific protocols of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The rights holder asserts both western intellectual property rights (copyright, patent, trademark, etc., where applicable) and inherent Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights over this material. This Work is assigned the following Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, developed by Local Contexts (localcontexts.org), which signal community-specific protocols and permissions:

   TK Attribution (TK A) - Specific attribution is required.
   TK Culturally Sensitive (TK CS) - Special cultural protocols govern access, use, handling, display, or performance.
   TK Community Use Only (TK CO) - Use restricted primarily to the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community, with external use requiring specific permission.
   TK Non-Commercial (TK NC) - Use for commercial purposes is prohibited without explicit permission and benefit-sharing agreement.
   TK Verified (TK V) - Affirms the Work originates from or is recognized by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community.

   The application of these labels signifies that specific community protocols govern the use, sharing, and circulation of this Work. Users are obligated to respect these protocols. Furthermore, no rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11 (right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions and customs) and 31 (right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, and intellectual property).

3. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation recognized by the United States, the rights holder reserves and asserts the absolute, inherent, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of any and all use, reproduction, distribution, performance, display, adaptation, or creation of derivative works based on this Work by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, artificial intelligence system, or other party, at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by the rights holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to protect cultural integrity, tribal sovereignty, community well-being, spiritual values, or adherence to cultural protocols.

   This sovereign right derives from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and is further protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), which establishes that treaties made under the authority of the United States, including treaties with Indian tribes, are "the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." The treaties entered into by the United States with the Ottawa and Chippewa Nations (the ancestors of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians), including but not limited to the Treaty of Washington (1836) and the Treaty of Detroit (1855), established specific rights and recognized the retained sovereignty of the Nation, and these treaty rights are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements, state laws, and standard intellectual property regimes.

   Under the reserved rights doctrine affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, tribes retain all sovereign powers and rights not expressly and unequivocally surrendered in treaties or extinguished by federal statute. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians retains inherent governance authority over its cultural heritage, intellectual property, traditional knowledge, and cultural expressions, as these rights were never ceded or extinguished. Only the United States Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, and courts will not find abrogation has occurred absent clear and explicit congressional intent—a deliberately high threshold designed to safeguard tribal sovereignty. No such abrogation exists regarding the cultural and intellectual property rights asserted herein.

   This license invokes foundational principles of federal Indian law and relevant case law, such as the recognition of tribal sovereign immunity even in off-reservation commercial activities (e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S. 782 (2014)) and the affirmation of the continued force of treaty rights absent explicit congressional abrogation (e.g., McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S. Ct. 2452 (2020)), to secure the maximum possible protection for the rights associated with this Work.

   The superior legal and moral force of these treaty-protected and inherent sovereign rights means that:
   a) This license invokes protections that exceed and may supersede standard copyright, patent, or other intellectual property laws, as well as conflicting state laws, based on the Supremacy Clause and principles of federal Indian law.
   b) The legal force and enforceability of this sovereign revocation right cannot be diminished, waived, or negated through standard contract law principles, state court interpretations, or doctrines such as estoppel or laches (subject to review under applicable tribal law).
   c) All courts, whether tribal, federal, or state, are constitutionally and judicially required to interpret these rights and the provisions of this license liberally in favor of the tribal interests and tribal sovereignty, following the established canons of construction for Indian treaties and laws.
   d) Any dispute regarding the rights asserted herein, including the revocation right, must be analyzed primarily within the framework of federal Indian law, tribal law, and treaty rights, not merely standard intellectual property or contract law.
   e) The Indian canons of construction mandate that any ambiguity in this license or related agreements must be resolved in favor of the tribal rights holder and the interests of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.
   f) The treaty rights underpinning this license are recognized as having a superior legal status to other forms of domestic law in accordance with the Supremacy Clause.

   Upon receiving notification of revocation from the rights holder or an authorized representative of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, all parties using, holding, or distributing the Work must immediately comply by undertaking the following actions:
   a) Ceasing any and all use, display, performance, reproduction, distribution, adaptation, modification, transmission, or other exploitation of the Work in any form or medium.
   b) Permanently removing, deleting, and/or destroying all copies, instances, derivatives, recordings, summaries, analyses, or other manifestations of the Work under their possession or control.
   c) Providing written confirmation of full compliance with the revocation notice to the rights holder within 7 calendar days of receiving the notice.
   d) Formally acknowledging the superior force of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights in this specific context as the basis for the revocation.
   e) Surrendering any derivative materials, analyses, datasets, or products based on the Work to the rights holder, or destroying them, as directed in the revocation notice.

This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable governing law (as defined in Section 9) but does not limit remedies available for violation of this license itself.

12. NO WAIVER OF SOVEREIGNTY OR RIGHTS
    Nothing contained in this license shall be construed explicitly or implicitly as a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians or any of its entities or officials. Furthermore, nothing herein constitutes a waiver of any rights held by the rights holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians under tribal law, federal Indian law, treaty rights, international law, or indigenous customary law. The rights holder and the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians expressly reserve all rights not explicitly granted or restricted herein. The tribal sovereign immunity of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians extends, to the maximum extent recognized by law, to the individual rights holder as a tribal member asserting rights intrinsically connected to tribal sovereignty, cultural heritage, and self-governance, particularly when acting in accordance with tribal protocols or authority.

13. SEVERABILITY AND INTERPRETATION
    If any provision, clause, or part of this license is held by a court or forum of competent jurisdiction (as determined under Section 9) to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under the applicable governing law, such provision shall be modified by the court/forum to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable while most closely preserving the original intent. If such modification is not possible, the specific provision, clause, or part shall be deemed severed from this license, and the remaining provisions, clauses, and parts shall continue in full force and effect, interpreted to give maximum effect to their original intent and the overarching goals of protecting tribal sovereignty and cultural heritage.

    Consistent with the established canons of construction in federal Indian law, any ambiguity or uncertainty in the interpretation of this license shall be resolved liberally in favor of the rights holder and the protection of tribal rights, sovereignty, and cultural interests.
