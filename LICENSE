COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS

**PREAMBLE**
This Work (defined below) is created, held, or stewarded by ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ (Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi), also known legally as JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE, professionally documented as Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder), a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians (GTBOCI), a federally recognized sovereign tribal nation (hereafter referred to as the "Rights Holder"). This license is grounded in the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to protect, control, and govern the use of their intellectual property, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge (TK), traditional cultural expressions (TCEs), and associated data (Indigenous Data Sovereignty). The unique status of tribal sovereign nations provides legal and cultural protections extending beyond standard intellectual property law regimes. This license aims to facilitate respectful engagement while upholding Tribal sovereignty, cultural integrity, data governance rights, and ensuring equitable benefit sharing as a mechanism for reclaiming value derived from Indigenous knowledge and heritage often subject to historical extraction.

This license applies to 'the Work.' 'The Work' primarily encompasses the Indigenous creations contained directly **within this repository**, including software, digital materials, cultural expressions, tangible heritage, and knowledge systems. **Furthermore, 'the Work' explicitly includes any other creations by the Rights Holder (such as presentations, publications, or artworks) that are either (a) directly published as files within this repository or (b) explicitly identified elsewhere within this repository (e.g., in the README file) as being governed by this specific license instance.** It expressly integrates and asserts rights based upon principles from Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels and Protocols, federal Indian law, the laws and customs of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles, and international indigenous rights frameworks, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

**Scope of License Application:** This license governs the use of the content defined as "the Work" above. It explicitly **does not** extend to:
*   **(a) Git Submodules:** Any materials included via Git submodules are separate works governed by their own respective licenses.

This includes, but is not limited to, selling the Work, licensing it for a fee, using it in products or services offered for sale, using it in advertising or marketing materials for commercial products/services, or incorporating it into a business operation that generates revenue. Non-profit or academic use may still be considered Commercial Use if it involves cost-recovery exceeding direct costs, generates revenue streams, or serves to enhance the commercial standing or funding prospects of the using entity in a manner beyond standard academic dissemination.
   c) **"Derivative Work":** A work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a "derivative work". For the purposes of this license, this also explicitly includes datasets derived or extracted from the Work, software incorporating code or concepts from the Work, and AI models trained using the Work.
   d) **"Indigenous Data Sovereignty":** The inherent right of Indigenous peoples to govern the collection, ownership, access, analysis, interpretation, management, storage, dissemination, and reuse of data pertaining to them, their lands, resources, cultures, knowledge systems, or any information derived therefrom. This includes the right to determine how data is used, who benefits from it, and to ensure data practices align with Indigenous values and protocols.
   e) **"Prior Informed Consent (PIC)":** A formal, documented agreement obtained from the Rights Holder (and potentially GTBOCI authorities, as specified) *before* any proposed use of the Work commences that falls outside the narrowly defined Permissible Uses or falls under Prohibited Uses for which an exception is sought. PIC requires full disclosure of the intended use, adherence to specified conditions, and is subject to revocation. (See Section 7).

All usage, benefit-sharing, and data governance are governed by the COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE FOR INDIGENOUS CREATIONS WITH TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, AND WEALTH RECLAMATION PROTECTIONS.}
   }
   ```

   Furthermore, any project, publication, presentation, performance, exhibition, or product utilizing, referencing, or derived from this Work must visibly and respectfully acknowledge the Indigenous authorship/stewardship and tribal affiliation in all relevant contexts, recognizing the work is subject to the traditional knowledge protocols, data governance, and laws of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

**4. TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE (TK) & DATA SOVEREIGNTY PROTECTION AND LABELING**
   This Work embodies or contains elements of Traditional Knowledge (TK), Traditional Cultural Expressions (TCEs), or knowledge associated with genetic resources, which require special protection based on the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples and the specific protocols of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. The Rights Holder asserts both western intellectual property rights (copyright, patent, trademark, etc., where applicable) and inherent Indigenous cultural and intellectual property rights, including Indigenous Data Sovereignty. This Work is assigned the following Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels, developed by Local Contexts (localcontexts.org), which signal community-specific protocols and permissions:

   *   **TK Attribution (TK A):** Specific attribution is required as detailed in Section 3.
   *   **TK Culturally Sensitive (TK CS):** Special cultural protocols govern access, use, handling, display, or performance. Users must exercise caution and respect.
   *   **TK Community Use Only (TK CO):** Use restricted primarily to the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community. External use requires specific Prior Informed Consent (PIC).
   *   **TK Non-Commercial (TK NC):** Use for Commercial Purposes is prohibited without explicit PIC and a negotiated, equitable benefit-sharing agreement.
   *   **TK Verified (TK V):** Affirms the Work originates from or is recognized by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians community and the Rights Holder.

   The application of these labels signifies that specific community protocols govern the use, sharing, circulation, and data management related to this Work. Users are obligated to respect these protocols. Furthermore, no rights are waived under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly Articles 11 (right to practice and revitalize cultural traditions and customs) and 31 (right to maintain, control, protect and develop cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, associated data, and intellectual property).

**5. SOVEREIGN REVOCATION RIGHT UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY**
   As a member of a sovereign tribal nation recognized by the United States, the Rights Holder (ᓂᐲᔥ ᐙᐸᓂᒥᑮ-ᑭᓇᐙᐸᑭᓯ / Nbiish Waabanimikii-Kinawaabakizi / JUSTIN PAUL KENWABIKISE / Nbiish-Justin Paul Kenwabikise, Anishinaabek Dodem (Anishinaabe Clan): Animikii (Thunder)) reserves and asserts the absolute, inherent, irrevocable, and perpetual right to demand the immediate cessation of any and all use, reproduction, distribution, performance, display, adaptation, or creation of derivative works based on this Work by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, artificial intelligence system, or other party, at any time and for any reason deemed necessary by the Rights Holder or the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians to protect cultural integrity, tribal sovereignty, data sovereignty, community well-being, spiritual values, or adherence to cultural protocols.

   This sovereign right derives from the inherent sovereignty of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and is further protected by Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), treaties including the Treaty of Washington (1836) and the Treaty of Detroit (1855), the reserved rights doctrine, and foundational principles of federal Indian law (e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, McGirt v. Oklahoma). These rights are constitutionally superior to ordinary contractual agreements, state laws, and standard intellectual property regimes.

   The superior legal and moral force of these treaty-protected and inherent sovereign rights means this license invokes protections that exceed standard IP laws, the revocation right cannot be diminished by standard contract principles, courts must interpret ambiguities liberally in favor of tribal interests (Indian canons of construction), and disputes must be analyzed primarily within the framework of federal Indian law, tribal law, and treaty rights.

   Upon receiving notification of revocation from the Rights Holder or an authorized representative of GTBOCI, all parties must immediately cease all use, permanently remove/destroy all copies and derivatives, provide written confirmation of compliance within 7 calendar days, acknowledge the superior force of tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, and surrender or destroy derivative materials as directed.

**6. PROHIBITED USES**
   This Work, in whole or in part, may *not* be used, accessed, reproduced, distributed, performed, displayed, adapted, or exploited by any individual, entity, corporation, institution, AI system, or other party for any of the following purposes or in any of the following manners, unless explicitly permitted in writing through Prior Informed Consent (PIC, see Section 7) obtained from the Rights Holder and potentially the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians:

      c) Costs of issuing public corrections or retractions.
      d) Costs of notifying affected parties or communities.
      e) Reasonable administrative fees incurred by the Rights Holder or GTBOCI in managing the response to the violation.

   9.4 PROPERTY TRANSFER PROVISIONS: For willful, flagrant, or repeated violations, the Rights Holder or competent tribal court may require the transfer of:

      c) Equipment or materials primarily used in the unauthorized exploitation.
      d) Any patents, trademarks, or other registered IP improperly obtained based on the Work.

   9.5 JURISDICTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS:
      a) The GTBOCI Tribal Court (or alternative forum selected per Section 10) has primary jurisdiction over disputes concerning remedies.
      b) These provisions are intended to be enforceable in tribal, federal, and state courts, based on consent to the license terms, treaty rights, principles of comity, and full faith and credit doctrines.
      c) The Rights Holder reserves the right to utilize traditional GTBOCI dispute resolution mechanisms.
      d) Unauthorized users, by their use, consent to the jurisdiction of the chosen tribal forum for disputes related to remedies under this license.
      e) Judgments from the competent tribal court regarding remedies are intended to be enforceable in other jurisdictions.

   9.6 WAIVER OF DEFENSES: By using the Work, users waive the right to assert defenses against the remedies outlined herein based on:
      a) Lack of knowledge of the specific terms of this license or the compensation provisions.
      b) Jurisdictional challenges to the chosen tribal forum, subject to applicable law regarding tribal court jurisdiction.
      c) Standard statutes of limitations or laches defenses, unless such defenses are explicitly recognized under GTBOCI law or the law applied by the competent forum.
      d) Challenges to the reasonableness of compensation calculated according to the principles outlined in this license.
      e) Claims of sovereign immunity by governmental or quasi-governmental entities, to the extent waiver can be effected by acceptance of license terms or is otherwise inapplicable under federal Indian law.

   9.7 CONTINUITY OF COMPENSATION RECOVERY IN EVENT OF RIGHTS HOLDER INCAPACITATION OR DETENTION:
      a) Undiminished Obligation: In the event the Rights Holder is temporarily detained, arrested, jailed, incarcerated, hospitalized, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to directly receive or manage the remedies awarded under this Section 9 ("Incapacitated"), the violating party's obligation to provide full compensation and restitution remains absolute and undiminished.
      b) Payment Instructions and Representation: The violating party shall strictly follow written instructions regarding the direction of payments or transfer of assets required as remedies. Such instructions may come from:
         i. The Rights Holder directly, if able.
         ii. An individual pre-designated in writing by the Rights Holder to act on their behalf in such circumstances (e.g., via alternative payee designation, durable power of attorney, or similar instrument recognized under applicable law).
         iii. A court-appointed fiduciary, guardian, conservator, or other legal representative authorized to act on the Rights Holder's behalf, evidenced by appropriate court documentation.
         iv. An authorized representative of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians designated by tribal authorities in accordance with tribal law and governance procedures to act on the Rights Holder's behalf specifically for the purpose of receiving and managing remedies under this license.
      c) Purpose of Redirection: Remedies redirected under this section are intended to ensure the Rights Holder's needs are met (including but not limited to legal fees, medical costs, dependent support, commissary funds, etc.) and that the value reclamation goals of this license are fulfilled without interruption, even during periods of incapacitation or detention.
      d) Escrow Protocol: If the Rights Holder is Incapacitated and no designated representative (as per 9.7(b)) provides valid payment instructions within thirty (30) calendar days of the violating party becoming aware (or being reasonably expected to be aware) of the incapacitation, the violating party shall immediately place all monetary remedies then due or accruing into a segregated, interest-bearing escrow account with a reputable financial institution. The violating party must provide prompt written notification to the Rights Holder's last known address and to the designated legal or administrative office of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians regarding the establishment, location, and status of the escrowed funds, with updates provided at least quarterly. The violating party shall bear the costs of establishing and maintaining the escrow account and shall release the escrowed funds, including any accrued interest, promptly upon receiving proper instructions from the Rights Holder or an authorized representative as defined in 9.7(b).
      e) Confidentiality: The violating party shall maintain strict confidentiality regarding any non-public information about the Rights Holder's incapacitation or detention obtained solely through the process of executing remedy instructions or establishing escrow under this subsection, except as strictly required by law or necessary to execute payment/escrow instructions. Unauthorized disclosure may constitute a separate violation of this license.
      f) Survival and Non-Waiver: The obligations under this subsection 9.7 survive any incapacitation or detention of the Rights Holder and do not waive or diminish any other remedies available under this license or applicable law. Failure by the Rights Holder or their representative to provide immediate instructions does not constitute a waiver of the right to receive full compensation.

**10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND JURISDICTION**
    10.1 PRIMARY TRIBAL JURISDICTION: The Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians Tribal Court shall be the primary and preferred forum for resolving any disputes arising under or related to this license, including but not limited to interpretation of terms, alleged violations, assessment of compensation, and enforcement of remedies. All parties using the Work under this license are deemed to have consented to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the GTBOCI Tribal Court for such disputes and expressly subject themselves to its authority. Tribal court decisions shall be accorded full faith and credit and comity to the maximum extent provided under applicable law (including 28 U.S.C. § 1738 and relevant case law).

    10.2 SECONDARY JURISDICTIONS: In circumstances where GTBOCI Tribal Court proceedings are determined by that court itself to be unavailable or impractical for a specific dispute, or where enforcement of a tribal court judgment is sought in another forum, the following forums may have concurrent or subsequent jurisdiction, subject always to the principles of tribal sovereignty and exhaustion of tribal remedies:
       a) The United States Federal District Court with geographic jurisdiction encompassing the lands of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, particularly for matters arising under federal Indian law or requiring interpretation of federal statutes or treaties.
       b) If federal court jurisdiction is unavailable, the courts of the State of Michigan, solely to the extent necessary and permissible under federal Indian law and principles of comity, and provided that tribal law and perspectives are given appropriate weight.
       c) For international disputes, the choice of forum and applicable law shall prioritize mechanisms that respect Indigenous sovereignty and international indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., WIPO procedures for TK/TCEs, application of lex originis principles), as determined appropriate by the Rights Holder.

    10.3 JURISDICTIONAL PRINCIPLES: The interpretation and application of jurisdictional rules shall be guided by:
       a) The paramount status of tribal law, custom, and treaty rights, which shall supersede conflicting state or common law principles where applicable.
       b) The established Indian canons of construction, requiring ambiguities in laws, treaties, and agreements (including this license) to be interpreted liberally in favor of tribal interests and sovereignty.
       c) The doctrine of tribal court exhaustion, which generally requires parties to exhaust remedies in tribal court before seeking relief in federal or state courts, particularly for disputes arising on tribal lands or involving tribal members and governance.

    10.4 TRADITIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The Rights Holder explicitly reserves the right, consistent with GTBOCI law and custom, to utilize or require participation in traditional GTBOCI dispute resolution methods, forums, or councils of elders, either as an alternative or supplement to judicial proceedings. Decisions reached through such traditional processes shall be accorded respect and weight within the community and potentially by other forums under principles of comity.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

**13. SEVERABILITY AND PERPETUITY**
    This license is intended to be perpetual and apply to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. If any provision of this license is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in a particular jurisdiction by a competent forum (giving due deference to the chosen tribal forum), such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this license or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. The provision in question shall be reformed, construed, and enforced in such jurisdiction to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, in a manner that most closely achieves the original purpose and intent of this license, particularly the protection of Indigenous rights, sovereignty, and wealth reclamation principles. This license shall be interpreted holistically to uphold these core principles.
