## Phase 0: Solo Acceleration Track (Immediate: Days 1-14)

**CRITICAL PRIORITY**: These steps can be completed by a single individual with minimal resources to establish immediate legitimacy and momentum. Focus on actions that require no committees, no meetings, and minimal cost.

*   **Step 0.1: Secure EIN (Federal Tax ID) - DAY 1**
    *   **Action:** Apply online at irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/get-an-employer-identification-number (available Monday-Friday, 7am-10pm ET)
    *   **Details:** Process takes 15 minutes, completely free, requires only your SSN and basic tribal corporation information. Select "Corporation" as entity type. Print confirmation letter immediately. **This is your most critical first step** - without an EIN, you cannot open bank accounts or receive funds.
    *   **Requirements:** Have charter ready, your SSN, and tribal corporation address prepared

*   **Step 0.2: Establish Digital Presence - DAY 2-3**
    *   **Action:** Secure domain (e.g., beaverislandandband.org) via GoDaddy/Namecheap (~$12/year) and set up professional email addresses
    *   **Details:** Your tech background makes this trivial. Use your cybersecurity expertise to implement secure email (Google Workspace for Nonprofits or ProtonMail for enhanced security per Zero Trust framework in Article VIII). This establishes professional credibility immediately.

*   **Step 0.3: Document Charter Ratification - DAY 4-5**
    *   **Action:** Conduct formal self-ratification as founding member per Article X, creating written record with signatures, dates, and documentation photos
    *   **Details:** As Interim Hereditary Chief with plenary authority (Article III, Sec 2a), you can initiate this process. Document with photos of signed charter, timestamped digital records, and formal resolution establishing the ratification date. This creates legal foundation for all subsequent actions.

*   **Step 0.4: Secure Free Legal Consultation - DAY 6-7**
    *   **Action:** Contact Michigan State University Indigenous Law Clinic (Indigenous Law & Policy Center, MSU College of Law) for free consultation on tribal establishment process
    *   **Details:** Email or call to schedule consultation on federal recognition process, tribal corporation establishment, and Michigan-specific considerations. MSU has expertise with Great Lakes tribes and can provide crucial early validation of your approach.

*   **Step 0.5: Submit NARF Legal Assistance Request - DAY 8-10**
    *   **Action:** Write formal letter to Native American Rights Fund Case Selection Committee requesting legal assistance with federal recognition process
    *   **Details:** Mail to: Native American Rights Fund, Attention: Requests for Assistance, 250 Arapahoe Ave, Boulder, CO 80302. Include: charter copy, genealogical documentation, specific request for federal recognition guidance. NARF has "Recognition" as a practice area and "fees are negotiable."

*   **Step 0.6: Open Tribal Bank Account - DAY 11-14**
    *   **Action:** With EIN and ratified charter, contact Native American Bank (nativeamericanbank.com) or local credit union experienced with tribal accounts
    *   **Details:** Call ahead to discuss requirements. Bring: EIN confirmation letter, ratified charter, photo ID, initial deposit ($100-500). Some institutions may require in-person visit. Research shows Native American Bank specifically serves tribal communities nationwide.
