// Refined Updates to working-LICENSE (Verified via Web Search on Best Practices for Indigenous IP/TK Licenses)

// Based on sources: Duke Law (sui generis frameworks), IP Brief (TK Labels for repatriation), SFU IPinCH (TK licensing), Wikipedia (UNDRIP), and others. Updates enhance enforceability while respecting collective ownership and sovereignty.

1. **Add a Clear "Attachment and Notice" Clause** (New Section after Section 3, around line 300)
   - **Rationale**: Enhances binding by ensuring users are on notice; mirrors OSS best practices (e.g., GPL) and makes implicit acceptance explicit, reducing challenges to mutual assent. Per SFU IPinCH, clear notices are crucial for TK licenses to signal cultural protocols upfront.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Insert a new section: "This license must be prominently attached to or referenced in all distributions of the Work (e.g., via metadata, README, or URL link). Use constitutes acceptance. Sample notice: 'This Work is governed by the COMPREHENSIVE RESTRICTED USE LICENSE at [canonical URL].' Include TK Label icons for immediate cultural signaling."

2. **Strengthen Sui Generis Rights with Fallback to Standard IP** (Update Section "Relationship to Conventional Intellectual Property Law", lines 150-200)
   - **Rationale**: Addresses gaps in TK/TCE protection; courts may strike overbroad claims, so add explicit ties to copyright registration and moral rights (e.g., Berne Convention) as a "fallback" for enforceability. Duke Law emphasizes sui generis rights via contracts to bridge Western IP limitations for indigenous knowledge.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Add: "The Rights Holder encourages registration of copyrightable elements with the U.S. Copyright Office or equivalents. Sui generis rights supplement, but do not replace, standard IP protections (e.g., moral rights under 17 U.S.C. ยง 106A). In jurisdictions without TK recognition, enforce via contract law."

3. **Incorporate Optional CC Layering** (Update Section 4.3, lines 400-450)
   - **Rationale**: Your selective compatibility is good, but explicitly allowing optional CC-BY-NC-SA layering (with TK overrides) improves adoption and enforceability, as CC licenses have strong precedent (e.g., in EU courts). IP Brief notes CC can complement TK Labels for digital repatriation and wider sharing.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Expand: "Users may optionally apply CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 to derivatives, provided it subordinates to this license's TK Labels, PIC, and CARE Principles. Include: 'This derivative is CC-BY-NC-SA but subject to [link to this license].' Ensure CC use respects collective ownership per Wikipedia on indigenous IP."

4. **Add TK Label Certification and WIPO References** (Update Section 4, lines 350-400)
   - **Rationale**: Formal certification (e.g., via Local Contexts) adds legitimacy; tie to WIPO Treaty (2024) for international binding, as it's gaining ratifications and supports PIC/benefit-sharing. SFU IPinCH highlights certification as a best practice for TK licensing to ensure cultural authority.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Add: "TK Labels are certified via Local Contexts (localcontexts.org). Users must comply with WIPO Treaty disclosure requirements upon ratification in their jurisdiction, including source attribution for TK/TCEs."

5. **Clarify Jurisdictional Challenges and Exhaustion** (Update Section 11, lines 900-950)
   - **Rationale**: Reinforces tribal primacy but adds practical handling for non-tribal challenges (e.g., via exhaustion doctrine from *National Farmers Union v. Crow Tribe*). This reduces dismissal risks in federal courts. Duke Law recommends explicit exhaustion to protect indigenous governance in IP disputes.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Add subsection: "Challenges to tribal jurisdiction must first be raised in the primary tribal forum (11.1). Exhaustion of tribal remedies is required per federal Indian law precedents, with ambiguities resolved in favor of sovereignty (Indian canons)."

6. **Enhance Audit and Enforcement with Cost Recovery** (Update Section 12, lines 950-970; cross-reference Section 11.9)
   - **Rationale**: Builds on your audit rights; explicitly tying to digital forensics (Section 9A.7) and cost recovery strengthens remedies, making breaches more deterrent (per OSS enforcement cases like *Artifex v. Hancom*). Wikipedia notes cost recovery supports indigenous IP enforcement against misappropriation.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Expand: "Audits may include digital forensics per Section 9A.7. Breaching parties bear all costs, including minimum $10,000 liquidated damages per violation, to enable wealth reclamation for communities."

7. **Add Public Policy Safeguard** (New clause in Section 15, lines 1000-1020)
   - **Rationale**: Courts may invalidate terms violating public policy (e.g., perpetual inalienability); add a safeguard to reform overbroad provisions, improving severability. Duke Law warns that public policy challenges are common in TK protections, so reformation clauses enhance resilience.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Insert: "If any provision conflicts with public policy, it shall be reformed to align with indigenous rights frameworks (e.g., UNDRIP) while preserving intent, per sui generis best practices."

8. **Update Versioning Notice for User Alerts** (Update lines 1087-1096)
   - **Rationale**: Your notice is strong, but add an opt-in for email alerts to show good faith, reducing claims of unfair surprise. SFU IPinCH emphasizes ongoing communication in TK licenses for trust-building.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Add: "Users may subscribe for update notifications at [email/contact]. Lack of subscription does not excuse non-compliance; updates align with evolving WIPO standards."

9. **Add Explicit UNDRIP and Benefit-Sharing Mechanisms** (Update Preamble and Section 6A, lines 50-100 and 500-550)
   - **Rationale**: Wikipedia and Duke Law stress UNDRIP (Articles 11, 31) for collective rights; explicit benefit-sharing (e.g., royalties to trusts) makes licenses more enforceable internationally and aligns with WIPO Treaty.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Add: "This license implements UNDRIP by requiring equitable benefit-sharing (minimum 20% of commercial proceeds to Legacy Trust). Violations trigger repatriation under indigenous data sovereignty."

10. **Incorporate International Enforceability Clause** (New subsection in Section 11, around line 950)
   - **Rationale**: For global users, tie to lex originis (law of origin) per WIPO standards (Duke Law); this strengthens cross-border binding for TK/TCEs.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Insert: "International disputes apply lex originis, prioritizing GTBOCI law and UNDRIP. Users consent to enforcement via New York Convention for arbitral awards."

11. **Add Repatriation Protocol for Misappropriated TK** (New Section after Section 7, around line 600)
   - **Rationale**: IP Brief highlights repatriation via TK Labels/licenses; this adds a remedy for digital misappropriation, making the license more comprehensive and enforceable.
   - **Suggested Edit**: Insert: "Upon breach involving TK/TCEs, users must repatriate all derived data/materials per CARE Principles, with destruction verified by audit."

// End of refined list. These updates create a more enforceable, culturally aligned license.
